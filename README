This is FAI (Fully Automatic Installation) for Linux

		   FAIVERSIONSTRING
		
FAI is a non interactive system to install a Debian GNU/Linux
operating system on a PC cluster. You can take one or more virgin PCs,
turn on the power, and after a few minutes, Linux is installed,
configured, and running on the whole cluster, without any interaction
necessary. Thus it's a scalable method for installing and updating a
Beowulf cluster or a network of workstations unattended with little
effort involved. FAI uses the Debian distribution and a collection of
shell and Perl scripts for the installation process. Changes to the
configuration files of the operating system are made by cfengine,
shell and Perl scripts.

The home page for FAI is

This release of FAI is tested with the Debian 3.0 release (called
woody).
