This is FAI (Fully Automatic Installation) version FAIVERSIONSTRING

FAI is a tool for unattended mass deployment of Linux. It's a system
to install and configure Linux systems and software packages on
computers as well as virtual machines, from small labs to large-scale
infrastructures like clusters and virtual environments. You can take
one or more virgin PC's, turn on the power, and after a few minutes,
the systems are installed, and completely configured to your exact
needs, without any interaction necessary. It can be used for creating
custom disk images used in virtual machines or on a cloud-computing
platform. FAI uses Debian Linux but it can install and deploy multiple
distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL and SUSE. Changes to
the configuration files of the operating system can be made by shell
or Perl scripts or any other configuration software.
