This is FAI (Fully Automatic Installation) for Linux

                   FAIVERSIONSTRING

FAI is a non-interactive system to install, customize and manage Linux
systems and software configurations on computers as well as virtual
machines and chroot environments, from small networks to large
infrastructures and clusters. It's a tool for mass unattended Linux
installation. You can take one or more virgin systems, turn on the
power, and after a few minutes, the systems are installed, and
completely configured to your exact needs, without any interaction
necessary. Thus it's a scalable method for deploying and updating a
Beowulf cluster or a network of workstations unattended with little
effort involved. FAI uses the Debian distribution and a collection of
shell and Perl scripts for the installation process. Changes to the
configuration files of the operating system are made by cfengine,
shell and Perl scripts.

The home page for FAI is

This release of FAI is tested with the Debian 8 release.

I'm looking for short success stories or reports, so new users
can see how others are using FAI in several types of environment.

There's also a mailing list for FAI available. Mails may be
written in english or german.
