"a temporary LAN with four SUN workstations for a conference, which\n"
"lasted only a few days. I took these workstations out of our normal\n"

"The install client which will be installed using FAI, is booted via\n"

"from the\n"
"install server. After the kernel is started, the FAI startup script\n"
"performs the automatic installation which doesn't need any\n"
"interaction. First, the hard disks will be partitioned, file systems\n"
"are created and then software packages are installed. After that, the\n"
