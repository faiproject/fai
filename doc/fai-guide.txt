=== [[motivation]]Motivation

Have you ever performed identical installations of an operating system
several times? Would you like to be able to install a Linux cluster
with dozens of nodes single handedly?

Repeating the same task again and again is boring -- and will surely
lead to errors. Also a whole lot of time could be saved if the
installations were done automatically. An installation process with
manual interaction does not scale. But clusters have the habit of
growing over the years. Think long-term rather than planning just a
few months into the future.

In 1999, I had to perform an installation of a Linux cluster with one
server and 16 clients. Since I had much experience doing automatic
installations of Solaris operating systems on SUN SPARC hardware, the
idea to build an automatic installation for Debian was born. Solaris
has an automatic installation feature called JumpStart
footnote:[Solaris 8 Advanced Installation Guide at
http://docs.sun.com]. In conjunction with the auto-install scripts
from Casper Dik
footnote:[http://www.science.uva.nl/pub/solaris/auto-install], I could
save a lot of time not only for every new SUN computer, but also for
re-installation of existing workstations. For example, I had to build
a temporary LAN with four SUN workstations for a conference, which
lasted only a few days. I took these workstations out of our normal
research network and set up a new installation for the conference.
When it was over, I simply integrated the workstations back into the
research network, rebooted just once, and after half an hour,
everything was up and running as before. The configuration of all
workstations was exactly the same as before the conference, because
everything was performed by the same installation process. I also used
the automatic installation for reinstalling a workstation after a
damaged hard disk had been replaced. It took two weeks until I
received the new hard disk but only a few minutes after the new disk
was installed, the workstation was running as before. And this is why
I chose to adapt this technique to a PC cluster running Linux.



=== [[overview]]Overview and concepts

FAI is a non-interactive system to install, customize and manage Linux
systems and software configurations on computers as well as virtual
machines and chroot environments, from small networks to large
infrastructures and clusters. You can take one or more virgin PCs,
turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed,
configured and running on the whole cluster, without any interaction
necessary. Thus, it's a scalable method for installing and updating a
cluster unattended with little effort involved. FAI uses the Debian
GNU/Linux distribution and a collection of shell and Perl scripts for
the installation process. Changes to the configuration files of the
operating system can be made by cfengine, shell, Perl and expect
scripts.

FAI's target group are system administrators who have to install Linux
onto one or even hundreds of computers. Because it's a general purpose
installation tool, it can be used for installing a Beowulf cluster, a
rendering farm or a Linux laboratory or a classroom. Also large-scale
Linux networks with different hardware or different installation
requirements are easy to establish using FAI. But don't forget to plan
your installation. Chapter <<plan>> has some useful hints for this
topic.

First, some terms used in this manual are described.

install server:: 
The host where the package 'fai-server' is installed. It provides
several services and data for all install clients. In the examples of
this manual this host is called 'faiserver'.

install client::
A host which will be installed using FAI and a configuration provided
by the install server. Also called client for short. In this manual,
the example hosts are called 'demohost, nucleus, atom01, atom02,...'

configuration::
The details of how the installation of the clients should be
performed. All configuration data is stored in a certain directory
structure and is also called configuration space or config space for
short. It includes information about:

* Hard disk layout
* Local file systems, their types, mount points and mount options
* Software packages
* Keyboard layout, time zone, NIS, Xorg configuration, remote file
  systems, user accounts, printers ... 

nfsroot::
A file system located on the install server. It's the complete file
system for the install clients during the installation process. All
clients share the same nfsroot, which they mount read only.

=== [[work]]How does FAI work

The install client which will be installed using FAI, is booted via
network card or from CD or USB stick. It gets an IP address and boots
a Linux kernel which mounts its root file system via NFS from the
install server. After the kernel is loaded, the FAI startup script
performs the automatic installation which doesn't need any
interaction. First, the hard disks will be partitioned, file systems
are created and then software packages are installed. After that, the
new installed operating system is configured to your local needs using
some scripts. Finally the new operating system will be booted from the
local disk.

The details of how to install the computer (the configuration) are
stored in the configuration space on the install server. Configuration
files are shared among groups of computers if they are similar using
the class concept. So you need not create a configuration for every
new host. Hence, FAI is a scalable method to install a big cluster
with a great number of nodes.

FAI can also be used as a network rescue system. You can boot your
computer, but it will not perform an installation. Instead it will run
a fully functional Debian GNU/Linux without using the local hard
disks. Then you 
can do a remote login and backup or restore a disk partition, check a
file system, inspect the hardware or do any other task.

////
MT: here the class concept should be described, move the entire section
here.

== [[impatient]]Quickstart - For the impatient user

So, you do not like to read the whole manual? You like to try an
installation without reading the manual? OK. Here's how to succeed in
a few minutes.

* Install the package 'fai-quickstart' on your install server (see <<faisetup>>).

* Edit 'fai.conf' run fai-setup -v and read its output.
   
* Install the simple examples into the configuration space:

----
$ cp -a /usr/share/doc/fai-doc/examples/simple/* /srv/fai/config/
----

* Get the MAC address of your demo host.
* Add your host (try to name it 'demohost') to 'dhcpd.conf' and
 '/etc/hosts' (= your DNS) on the FAI server. 
* When using PXE, tell the install client to boot the install
  kernel and perform an installation during the next boot by calling
 `fai-chboot` on the install server.
----
fai-chboot -IFv demohost
----

* If you want to try FAI without setting up a PXE+DNS+DHCP-environment:
  put the host names into '/etc/hosts' inside the nfsroot at '/srv/fai/nfsroot' and use
  a CD/DVD to boot the client.
* Boot your demo host and enjoy the fully automatic installation.
* If the installation has finished successfully, the computer should boot a
small Debian system. You can login as user _demo_ or _root_ with password _fai_.

But now don't forget to read chapters <<plan>>, <<instprocess>> and <<config>>!



== [[inst]]Installing FAI

=== [[requirements]]Requirements

////
MT: split this section to mark the specific requirments:
  - boot media
  - source of the root file system
  - config source
////


The following items are required for an installation via FAI.

A computer::
The computer must have a network interface card footnote:[If you
install from USB stick or CD you do not need a network card]. Unless a
diskless installation should be performed a local hard disk is also
needed. No floppy disk, CD-ROM, keyboard or graphics adapter is
needed.

DHCP server::
The clients need one of these daemons to obtain boot information.

TFTP server::
The TFTP daemon is used for transferring the kernel to the
clients. It's only needed when booting from network card with a boot
PROM.

NFS-Root::
It is a directory which contains the whole file system for the install
clients during installation. It must be exported via NFS, so the
install clients can mount it. It will be created during the setup of
the FAI package and is also called *nfsroot*.

Debian mirror::
Access to a Debian mirror is needed. A local mirror of all Debian
packages or an `apt-proxy(8)` is recommended if you install several
computers.

Configuration space::
This directory tree, which contains the configuration data, is mounted
via NFS by default. But you can also get this directory from a
revision control system like CVS, subversion or Git.

The NFS server will be enabled automatically when installing the
_fai-server_ package.


=== [[debian-mirror]]How to create a local Debian mirror

////
MT: move this section near the end of the chapter, it's not as
important
////

The script `mkdebmirror` footnote:[You can find the script in
'/usr/share/doc/fai-doc/examples/utils/'] can be used for creating
your own local Debian mirror. This script uses the script
`debmirror(1)`. A partial Debian mirror only for i386 architecture for
Debian 5.0 (aka lenny) without the source packages needs about
{mirrorsize}GB of disk space. Accessing the mirror via HTTP will be the
default way in most cases. To see more output from the script call
+mkdebmirror -v+. A root account is not necessary to create and
maintain the Debian mirror.

You can use the command `fai-mirror(1)` for creating a partial mirror
that only contains the software packages that are used in the classes
in your configuration space. A partial mirror containing all package
for the simple examples from the package fai-doc will only need about
440MB of disk space.

To use HTTP access to the local Debian mirror, install a web server
and create a symlink to the local directory where your mirror is
located:

----
faiserver# apt-get install apache2
faiserver# ln -s /files/scratch/debmirror /var/www/debmirror
----

Create a file `sources.list(5)` in '/etc/fai/apt' which gives access
to your Debian mirror. An example can be found in
'/usr/share/doc/fai-doc/examples/etc'. Also add the IP-address of the
HTTP server to the variable +$NFSROOT_ETC_HOSTS+ in
'make-fai-nfsroot.conf' when the install clients have no DNS access.

////
MT: some link to a signing howto would be nice
////


=== [[faisetup]]Setting up FAI

To set up a FAI install server you need at least the packages
_fai-server_ and _fai-doc_. The package _fai-quickstart_ contains
dependencies on all required packages for an install server. Do not
install the package _fai-nfsroot_ on a normal system. This package can
only be installed inside the nfsroot.

If you would like to install all packages that are useful for a FAI
install server, use the following command

----
# aptitude install fai-quickstart
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree       
Reading extended state information      
Initializing package states... Done
Reading task descriptions... Done  

The following NEW packages will be installed:
  apt-move{a} isc-dhcp-server{a} fai-doc{a} fai-quickstart fai-server{a}
  genisoimage{a} inetutils-inetd{a} nfs-kernel-server{a} 
  openssh-server{a} syslinux-common{a} tftpd-hpa{a} 
0 packages upgraded, 11 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Need to get 2593kB of archives. After unpacking 8561kB will be used.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n/?] 
----

The configuration for the FAI package (not the configuration data for
the install clients) is defined in 'fai.conf'. Definitions that are
only used for creating the nfsroot are located in
'make-fai-nfsroot.conf'. Edit these files before calling
'fai-setup'. These are important variables in 'make-fai-nfsroot.conf':

FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP::
For building the nfsroot there's the command called
`debootstrap(8)`. It needs the location of a Debian mirror and the
name of the distribution (etch, lenny, sid) for which the basic Debian
system should be built.

NFSROOT_ETC_HOSTS::
If you use HTTP or FTP access to the Debian mirror, add its IP-address
and the name to this variable. For a Beowulf master node, add the name
and IP-address of both networks to it. This variable is not needed
when the clients have access to a DNS server.


These are important variables in 'fai.conf':

FAI_CONFIG_SRC::
This variables described how to access the configuration space on the
install clients. It's an Universal Resource Identifier
(URI). Currently supported methods are:

- +nfs://host/path/to/exported/config+
The config space is mounted from host via NFS.

- +cvs[+ssh]://user@host/path/to/cvsroot module[=tag]+
The config space is received from a cvs checkout.

- +svn://user@host/svnpath+ 
The config space checked out from a subversion repository. Also
supported are svn+file, svn+http, svn+ssh, svn+https and checkouts
without a user name.

- +git://host/path+
The config space checked out from a
git repository, host can be empty. Also supported is git+http. 

- +http://host/path/tarfile+
The config space will be downloaded from the given location via HTTP.
Furthermore +path/tarfile.md5+ will be downloaded and the md5sum will be
checked. +tarfile+ will be extracted by `ftar(8)`, and thus needs to have
a recognized suffix, such as .tar.gz.

If +$FAI_CONFIG_SRC+ is undefined in 'fai.conf', then the default is
to use an NFS mount from the FAI install server onto the install
client. It's the same as +nfs://`hostname`/$FAI_CONFIGDIR+ with the
host name determined on the install server. Remember that this
directory must be exported to all install clients, so that all files
can be read by root.


FAI_DEBMIRROR::
If you have NFS access to your local Debian mirror, specify the remote
file system. It will be mounted to +$MNTPOINT+, which must also be
defined. It's not needed if you use access via FTP or HTTP.

A list of variables used by FAI can be found at
http://wiki.fai-project.org/wiki/Variables.

The content of '/etc/fai/apt/sources.list' and +$FAI_DEBMIRROR+ are
used by the install server and also by the clients. If your install
server has multiple network cards and different host names for each
card (as for a Beowulf server), use the install server name which is
known by the install clients.

FAI uses `debootstrap(8)` and `apt-get(8)` to create the nfsroot file
system in '/srv/fai/nfsroot'. It needs about {nfsrootsize}MB of free
disk space. After editing 'fai.conf' and 'make-fai-nfsroot.conf' call
`fai-setup`.

include::includes/faisetup.txt[]


A complete example of 'fai-setup.log' is available on the FAI web
page.  It's important that you find both lines that are marked with an
asterisk in your output. Otherwise something went wrong. If you'll get
a lot of blank lines, it's likely that you are using _konsole_, the X
terminal emulation for KDE which has a bug. Try again using _xterm_.

The warning messages from dpkg about dependency problems can be
ignored.  If you have problems running fai-setup, they usually stem
from `make-fai-nfsroot(8)`. Adding '-v' gives you a more verbose output
which may help you pinpoint the error. The output is written to
'/var/log/fai/make-fai-nfsroot.log'.  It may help to enter the chroot
environment manually using this command.

----
faiserver# chroot /srv/fai/nfsroot/live/filesystem.dir
----

The setup routine adds some lines to '/etc/exports' to export the
nfsroot and the configuration space to all hosts that belong to the
netgroup _faiclients_. If you already export a parent directory of
these directories, you may comment out these lines, since the kernel
NFS server has problems exporting a directory and one of its
subdirectories with different options.

All install clients must belong to this netgroup, in order to mount
these directories successfully. Netgroups are defined in the file
'/etc/netgroup' or in the corresponding NIS map. An example can be found in
'/usr/share/doc/fai-doc/examples/etc/netgroup'. For more information, 
read the manual pages `netgroup(5)` and the NIS HOWTO. After changing
the netgroups, the NFS server has to reload its configuration. Use the
following command:

----
faiserver# /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server reload
----

The setup also creates the account _fai_ (defined by +$LOGUSER+) if
not already available. So you can add a user before calling
`fai-setup(8)` using the command `adduser(8)` and use this as your
local account for saving log files. The log files of all install
clients are saved to the home directory of this account. If you boot
from network card, you should change the primary group of this
account, so this account has write permissions to '/srv/tftp/fai' in
order to change the symbolic links to the kernel image which is booted
by a client.

//// 
MT: the log files - which ones? Give a
little explanation here
////

After that, FAI is installed successfully on your server, but has no
configuration for the install clients. Start with the examples from
_/usr/share/doc/fai-doc/examples/simple/_ using the copy command above
and read <<config>>. Before you can set up a DHCP daemon, you
should collect some network information of all your install
clients. This is described in section <<mac>>.

When you make changes to 'fai.conf', 'make-fai-nfsroot.conf' the
nfsroot has to be rebuilt by calling `make-fai-nfsroot(8)`. If you
only like to install a new kernel to the nfsroot add the flags _-k_ or
_-K_ to +make-fai-nfsroot+. This will not recreate your nfsroot, but
only updates your kernel and kernel modules inside the nfsroot or add
additional packages into the nfsroot.

=== [[troublefaisetup]]Troubleshooting the setup

The setup of FAI adds the _fai_ account, exports file systems and
calls `make-fai-nfsroot(8)`. If you call _make-fai-nfsroot -v_ you
will see more messages. When using a local Debian mirror, it's
important that the install server can mount this directory via NFS. If
this mount fails, check '/etc/exports' and '/etc/netgroup'.


== [[booting]]Preparing booting

Before booting the client for the first time, you have to choose which
medium you use for booting. Normally, you will configure the computer
to boot via network card. The preferred method for booting is using
PXE. PXE is the Preboot Execution Environment which most modern
network cards support.  Also booting from CD-ROM or from an USB stick
is easy to set up.

=== [[pxeboot]]Booting from network card with a PXE conforming boot ROM

Almost all modern bootable network cards support the PXE boot environment.
Some network cards (e.g. on notebooks) have a fixed boot
configuration, so they can only use the PXE boot protocol. This
requires a PXE Linux boot loader and a special version of the _TFTP_
daemon, which is available in the Debian package
+tftpd-hpa+.

First, install following additional needed packages:

----
faiserver# apt-get install isc-dhcp-server syslinux-common tftpd-hpa
----

Then set up the DHCP daemon. A sample configuration file can be found
in '/usr/share/doc/fai-doc/examples/etc/dhcpd.conf'. Copy this file to
'/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf'.

The install client then loads the pxelinux boot loader which receives
its configuration via TFTP from a file in the directory
'/srv/tftp/fai/pxelinux.cfg' (defined by the variable +$TFTPROOT+ in
'make-fai-nfsroot.conf'). Using the command `fai-chboot(8)` you can
define which kernel will be loaded by the PXE Linux loader and which
additional parameters are passed to this kernel. You should read the
manual pages, which give you some good examples.

See '/usr/share/doc/syslinux/pxelinux.doc' for more detailed
information.

=== [[bootfloppy]]Creating a boot floppy

If your network card can't boot by itself, you can create a small boot
floppy that uses etherboot, which will provide the PXE feature for
your network card. So you can use DHCP and TFTP to get the install
kernel that was created with `mknbi-linux(8)`.  A lot of ethernet
cards support booting via ethernet if a special boot EPROM is inserted
or booted from floppy provided by http://rom-o-matic.net. In depth
documentation about booting via Ethernet may be found at
http://www.etherboot.org.


=== [[cdboot]]Booting from a CD-ROM

It's possible to perform an automatic installation from CD-ROM without
an install server. The CD-ROM contains all data needed for the
installation. The command `fai-cd(8)` puts the nfsroot, the
configuration space and a subset of the Debian mirror onto a
CD-ROM. The partial mirror is created using the command
`fai-mirror(1)` which contains all packages that are used by the
classes used in your configuration space.  A sample ISO image is
available at http://fai-project.org/fai-cd.

=== [[usbboot]]Booting from USB stick

Using the command `fai-cd(8)` you can also create a bootable USB
stick. First, format your stick with an ext2 file system (ext3 makes no
sense on flash memory devices). Then mount it.  After that call:

----
faiserver# fai-cd -m /path/to/mirror -u /path/to/mounted/stick
----

Then unmount the USB stick. The USB stick must be formatted with an
ext2 file system. VFAT is not yet supported. Currently the file system
that will be written onto the stick is not compressed.

=== [[mac]]Collecting Ethernet addresses

Now it's time to boot your install clients for the first time. They
will fail to boot completely, because no BOOTP or DHCP daemon is
running yet or recognizes the hosts. But you can use this first boot
attempt to easily collect all Ethernet addresses of the network cards.

You have to collect all Ethernet (MAC) addresses of the install
clients and assign a host name and IP address to each client. To
collect all MAC addresses, now boot all your install clients. While
the install clients are booting, they send broadcast packets to the
LAN. You can log the MAC addresses of these hosts by running the
following command simultaneously on the server:

----
faiserver# tcpdump -qtel broadcast and port bootpc >/tmp/mac.list
----

After the hosts have been sent some broadcast packets (they will fail
to boot because `bootpd` isn't running or does not recognize the MAC
address yet) abort `tcpdump` by typing _ctrl-c_. You get a list of all
unique MAC addresses with these commands:

----
faiserver$ perl -ane 'print "\U$F[0]\n"' /tmp/mac.list|sort|uniq
----

After that, you only have to assign these MAC addresses to host names
and IP addresses ('/etc/ethers' and '/etc/hosts' or corresponding NIS
maps). With this information you can configure your `DHCP`
daemon (see the section <<bootdhcp>>). I recommend to write the MAC
addresses (last three bytes will suffice if you have network cards
from the same vendor) and the host name in the front of each chassis.

=== [[bootdhcp]]Configuration of the DHCP daemon

An example for `dhcpd.conf(5)` is available in
'/usr/share/doc/fai-doc/examples/etc/dhcpd.conf', which is working
with version 3.x of the DHCP daemon. Start using this example and look
at all options used therein. The only FAI specific information inside
this configuration file is to set _filename_ to _fai/pxelinux.0_ and to
set _next-server_ and _server-name_. All other information is only
network related data, which is used in almost all DHCP configurations.
 
If you make any changes to the DHCP daemon configuration, you must
restart the daemon.

  # /etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server restart

By default, the DHCP daemon writes its log files to
'/var/log/daemon.log'. The command `fai-chboot(8)` is used for
creating a per host configuration for the pxelinux environment.


=== [[bootmesg]]Boot messages

When booting from network card with PXE you will see:

include::includes/bootexample.txt[]

When the copyright message of FAI is shown, the install client has
mounted the nfsroot footnote:['/srv/fai/nfsroot' from the install
server] to the clients' root directory. This is the whole file system
for the client at this moment.

After _task_confdir_ is executed, the configuration space is mounted
via NFS.

Before the installation is started (+$FAI_ACTION=install+) the computer
beeps three times. So, be careful when you hear three beeps but you do
not want to perform an installation!

==== [[booterror]]Troubleshooting the boot messages

This is the error message you will see, when your network card is
working, but the install server does not export the configuration
space directory to the install clients, mostly a problem of missing
permissions on the server side.

----
Begin: Mounting root file system... ...
eth0: link up

BusyBox v1.10.2 (Debian 1:1.10.2-1) Built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.
/bin/sh: can't access tty: job control turned off
(initramfs)
----

You will get a shell prompt and can look at the log files, for example
'/live.log' or /live-boot.log' (depending on the live-initramfs version) and
'/tmp/net-eth0.conf' or '/run/net-eth0.conf' (depending on the klibc version).
You can also enter the initramfs shell for debugging if you append the parameter
'break' to the kernel command line (see `initramfs-tools(8)` for further
information).

Use the following command on the install server to see which directories are exported
from the install server (named faiserver):

----
$ showmount -e faiserver
----

The following error message indicates that your install client doesn't
get an answer from a DHCP server. Check your cables or start the
`dhcpd(8)` daemon with the debug flag enabled.

____
  PXE-E51: No DHCP or BOOTP offers received
  Network boot aborted
____

If you get the following error message, the install kernel could not
detect your network card, for example because of a missing driver:

____
  Begin: Mounting root file system... ...
  Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!
____

Check the initrd in the nfsroot if the kernel driver of your network
card is included there.

=== [[sysinfo]]Collecting other system information 

If you set the variable +$FAI_ACTION+ to _sysinfo_ (for e.g. by using 
+fai-chboot -S+), the client will not install a new system, but will
collect a lot of system information. Type
_ctrl-c_ to get a shell or use _Alt-F2_ or _Alt-F3_ and you will get
another console terminal, if you have added _createvt_ to +$FAI_FLAGS+.

Remote login is available via the secure shell if _sshd_ is added to
+$FAI_FLAGS+. The encrypted password is set with the variable
+$FAI_ROOTPW+ in 'make-fai-nfsroot.conf' and defaults to "fai". You can
create the encrypted password using `mkpasswd(1)` and use the
`crypt(3)` or md5 algorithm. This is only the root password during the
installation process, not for the new installed system. You can also
log in without a password when using +$SSH_IDENTITY+. To log in from
your server to the install client (named demohost in this example)
use:

----
$ ssh root@demohost
Warning: Permanently added 'demohost,134.95.9.200' to the list of known hosts.
root@demohost's password: 
----

You now have a running Linux system on the install client without
using the local hard disk. Use this as a rescue system if your local
disk is damaged or the computer can't boot properly from hard
disk. You will get a shell and you can execute various commands
(`dmesg`, `lsmod`, `df`, `lspci`, ...). Look at the log file in
'/tmp/fai'. There you can find much information about the boot
process.

All log files from '/tmp/fai' are also written to the +$LOGSERVER+ (if
not defined: the server defined by +$SERVER+ from _get-boot-info_)
into the directory _~fai/demohost/sysinfo/_.

////
More general:
_~$LOGUSER/$HOSTNAME/$FAI_ACTION/_. 
////

Two additional symbolic links are created. The symlink 'last' points
to the log directory of the last FAI action performed. The symlinks
'last-install' and 'last-sysinfo' point to the directory with of the
last corresponding action.  Examples of the log files can be found on
the FAI homepage.

////
MT: I think it should be _~$LOGUSER/$HOSTNAME/$FAI_ACTION-\`DATE\`/_
////

FAI mounts all file systems it finds on the local disks read only. It
also tells you on which partition a file '/etc/fstab' exists. When
only one file system table is found, the partitions are mounted
according to this information. Here's an example:

----
demohost:~# df
Filesystem      1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
rootfs            4099064    414088   3645296  11% /

----

*This method can be used as a rescue environment!* If you need a file
system with read-write access use the `rwmount` command:

----
demohost# rwmount /target/home
----

=== [[checkbootp]]Checking parameters from  DHCP servers

If the install client boots with action _sysinfo_, you can also check
if all information from the DHCP daemon are received
correctly. The received information is written to
'/tmp/fai/boot.log'. An example of the result of a DHCP request can be
found in <<setuproutines>>.


=== [[reboot]]Rebooting the computer

At any time you can reboot the computer using the command `faireboot`,
also if logged in from remote. If the installation hasn't finished,
use _faireboot -s_, so the log files are also copied to the install
server.

== [[instprocess]]Overview of the installation sequence

The following tasks are performed during an installation after the
Linux kernel has booted on the install clients.

____
  confdir		# get config space
  setup			# early part of initialization
  defclass		# define classes
  defvar		# define variables
  action		# evaluate FAI_ACTION
  install		# Do the initial installation
  partition		# partition the harddisks, create file systems
  mountdisks		# mount the file systems
  extrbase		# extract the minimal base.tgz
  mirror		# get a Debian mirror via NFS
  debconf		# do Debian preseeding
  repository		# prepare access to the package repository
  updatebase		# Debian specific
  HOOK instsoft.FAIBASE	# fcopy kernel-img.conf
  instsoft		# install software packages
  configure		# call customization scripts
  finish		# do some cleanup, show installation time
  tests			# call tests if defined
  chboot		# call fai-chboot on the install server
  HOOK savelog.LAST	# grep for error messages in all log files
  savelog		# save log file to local dir and remote
  faiend		# reboot host, eject CD if needed
____
____

These are tasks, which are executed when a different action is performed

  dirinstall 	       # install a chroot environment
  softupdate	       # do a system configuration without the partitioning part
____


You can also define additional programs or scripts which will be run
on particular occasions. They are called _hooks_. Hooks can add
additional functions to the installation process or replace the
default subtasks of FAI. So it's very easy to customize the whole
installation process. Hooks are explained in detail in <<hooks>>.

The installation time is determined by the amount of software but also
by the speed of the processor and hard disk. Here are some sample
times. All install clients have a 100Mbit network card installed.
Using a 10 Mbit LAN does not decrease the installation time
considerably, so the network will not be the bottleneck when
installing several clients simultaneously.

____
  Intel Core2 Duo   ,    2GB,SATA disk,    3 GB software    14 min
  Athlon XP1600+    ,  896MB,SCSI disk,    1 GB software     6 min
  AMD-K7  500MHz    ,  320MB, IDE disk,  780 MB software    12 min
  PentiumPro 200MHz ,  128MB, IDE disk,  800 MB software    28 min
  Pentium III 850MHz,  256MB, IDE disk,  820 MB software    10 min
  Pentium III 850MHz,  256MB, IDE disk,  180 MB software     3 min
____


=== [[faimond]]Monitoring the installation

You can monitor the installation of all install clients with the
command `faimond(8)`. All clients check if this daemon is running on
the install server (or the machine defined by the variable
+$monserver+). Then, a message is sent when a task starts and ends. The
FAI monitor daemon prints this messages to standard output. There's
also a graphical frontend available, called `faimond-gui(1)`.


=== [[bootkernel]]Booting the kernel

The install client receives and loads the kernel and initial RAM
disk. The kernel boots up and load the RAM disk. It does some hardware
detection and then tries to figure where the root file system is
located. When booting from network, this is determined by parameters
from additional kernel parameters (_root=/dev/nfs_ and
_nfsroot=/srv/fai/nfsroot_). When booting from CD-ROM or USB stick the
kernel and initial RAM disk probes removable devices and tries to
figure out where the root file system is located. This may also be a
compressed file system (using squashfs).

After the root file system is mounted read only, it is made writable
by mounting a RAM disk via aufs (another unionfs) on top of it. So
it's possible for programs or daemons to write to files inside a read
only mounted file system.  We are using the package
`live-initramfs(7)` to mount the nfsroot and to make this file system
writable using aufs. The package _live-initramfs_ is only needed
inside the nfsroot and adds some initramfs hooks.


=== [[isetup]]Start and set up FAI

////
MT: CVS, SVN missing
////

After the install client has booted, only the script '/usr/sbin/fai'
footnote:[Since the root file system on the clients is mounted via
NFS, `fai` is located in
'/srv/fai/nfsroot/live/filesystem.dir/usr/sbin' on the install
server.] is executed. This is the main script which controls the
sequence of tasks for FAI. No other scripts in '/etc/init.d/' are
executed.

Additional parameters are received from the DHCP daemon and
the configuration space is made available via the configured method
(an NFS mount by default) from the install server to '$FAI'. The setup
is finished after additional virtual terminals are created and the
secure shell daemon for remote access is started on demand.

The variable +$FAI_CONFIG_SRC+ is used to get the FAI
configuration space, which is very important, since FAI cannot proceed
without the config space.

=== [[iclass]]Defining classes, variables and loading kernel modules

Now the script `fai-class(1)` is used to define classes. Therefore
several scripts in '$FAI/class/' are executed to define classes. All
scripts matching _[0-9][0-9]*_ (they start with two digits) are
executed in alphabetical order. Every word that these scripts print to
the standard output are interpreted as class names.  Scripts ending in
_.source_ are sourced, so they can define new classes by adding these
classes to the variable +$newclasses+.

The output of these scripts is ignored.  These classes are defined for
the install client. You can also say this client belongs to these
classes. A class is defined or undefined and has no value. Only
defined classes are of interest for an install client. The description
of all classes can be found in
'/usr/share/doc/fai-doc/classes_description.txt'. It is advisable to
document the job a new class performs. Then, this documentation is the
base for composing the whole configuration from classes.  The scripts
`20-hwdetect.source` loads kernel modules on demand.  The complete
description of all these scripts can be found in <<cscripts>>.

After defining the classes, every file matching _*.var_ with a prefix
which matches a defined class is executed to define variables.  There,
you should define the variable +$FAI_ACTION+ and others. By default,
+$FAI_ACTION+ is defined via the command `fai-chboot(8)`.


=== [[ipartition]]Partitioning local disks, creating file systems

For disk partitioning exactly one disk configuration file from
'$FAI/disk_config' is selected using classes. This file describes how
all the local disks will be partitioned, where file systems should be
created (and their types like ext2, ext3, reiserfs), and how they are
mounted. It's also possible to preserve the disk layout or to preserve
the data on certain partitions.

With FAI 3.2.8 the new partitioning tool called `setup-storage(8)` was
added to FAI. It uses `parted(8)` for editing the partition table and
now has support for software RAID and LVM. This tool uses a slightly
different format for the configuration files in 'disk_config' than the
old tool. Read the manual page for a detailed description of the new
format.

During the installation process all local file systems are mounted
relative to '/target'. For example '/target/home' will become '/home'
in the new installed system.

=== [[ipackages]]Installing software packages

When local file systems are created, they are all empty (except for
preserved partitions). Now the Debian base system and all requested
software packages are installed on the new file systems. First, the
base archive is unpacked, then the command `install_packages(8)`
installs all packages using `apt-get(8)` or `aptitude(1)` without any
manual interaction needed. If a packages requires another package,
both commands resolve this dependency by installing the required
package.

Classes are also used when selecting the configuration files in
'$FAI/package_config/' for software installation. The format of the
configuration files is described in <<packageconfig>>.

=== [[icscripts]]Site specific customization

After all requested software packages are installed, the system is
nearly ready to go. But not all default configurations of the software
packages will meet your site-specific needs. So you can call arbitrary
scripts which adjust the system configuration. Therefore scripts which
match a class name in '$FAI/scripts' will be executed. If
'$FAI/scripts/'+classname/+ is a directory, all scripts that match
_[0-9][0-9]*_ in this directory are executed. So it is possible to
have several scripts of different types (shell, cfengine, ...) to be
executed for one class. FAI comes with some examples for these
scripts, but you can write your own Bourne, bash, Perl, cfengine or
expect scripts.

More information about these scripts are described in <<cscripts>>.


=== [[itests]]Automated tests

After the customization scripts are executed, FAI will execute some
tests if available. Using these test, you can check for errors of the
installation or of the softupdate. Test scripts are called via
`fai-do-scripts(1)` and should append its messages to
_$LOGDIR/test.log_. A Perl module including some useful subroutines
can be found in _Faitest.pm_. A test can also define a new class for
executing another tests during next boot via the variable
+$ADDCLASSES+.


=== [[isavelog]]Save log files

When all installation tasks are finished, the log files are written to
_/var/log/fai/$HOSTNAME/install/_
footnote:['/var/log/fai/localhost/install/' is a link to this
directory.] on the new system and to the account on the install server
if +$LOGUSER+ is defined in 'fai.conf'. It is also possible to specify
another host as log saving destination through the variable
+$LOGSERVER+. If +$LOGSERVER+ is not defined, FAI uses the variable
+$SERVER+ which is only defined during an initial installation (by
get-boot-info). Make sure to set +$LOGSERVER+ in a _class/*.var_ script
if you are using the action _softupdate_.

Additionally, two symlinks will be created to indicated the last
directory written to.  By default log files will be copied to the log
server using scp.

You can use other methods to save logs to the remote server. The
currently selected method is defined by the +$FAI_LOGPROTO+ variable
in file 'fai.conf':


rsh::
Use the rcp command to copy the log files to
the log server.

ftp::
This option saves logs to the remote FTP server defined by the
+$LOGSERVER+ variable (+$SERVER+ value is used if not set). Connection
to the FTP server is done as user +$LOGUSER+ using password
+$LOGPASSWD+.  The FTP server log directory is defined in
+$LOGREMOTEDIR+. These variables are also defined in file
'fai.conf'. You need write access for the +$LOGREMOTEDIR+ on the FTP
server.

All files in the directory _/tmp/fai_ are copied to the
FTP server following this example:

____
  ftp://$LOGUSER:$LOGPASSWD@$LOGSERVER/$LOGREMOTEDIR/
____

none::
Don't save the log file to the install server.


=== [[ireboot]]Reboot the new installed system

At last the system is automatically rebooted if "reboot" was added to
+$FAI_FLAGS+. Normally this should boot the new installed system from
its second boot device, the local hard disk. To skip booting from
network card, you can use the command `fai-chboot(8)` to enable
localboot.



== [[plan]]Plan your installation, and FAI installs your plans

Before starting your installation, you should spend a lot of time in
planning your installation. When you're happy with your installation
concept, FAI can do all the boring, repetitive tasks to turn your
plans into reality. FAI can't do good installations if your concept is
imperfect or lacks some important details. Start planning the
installation by answering the following questions:


* Will I create a Beowulf cluster, or do I  have to install some desktop machines?
* What does my LAN topology look like?
* Do I have uniform hardware?  Will the hardware stay uniform in the future?
* Does the hardware need a special kernel?
* How should the hosts be named?
* How should the local hard disks be partitioned?
* Which applications will be run by the users?
* Do the users need a queueing system?
* What software should be installed?
* Which daemons should be started, and what  should the configuration for these look like?
* Which remote file systems should be mounted?
* How should backups be performed?

You also have to think about user accounts, printers, a mail system,
cron jobs, graphic cards, dual boot, NIS, NTP, timezone, keyboard
layout, exporting and mounting directories via NFS and many other
things. So, there's a lot to do before starting an installation. And
remember that knowledge is power, and it's up to you to use
it. Installation and administration is a process, not a product. FAI
can't do things you don't tell it to do.

But you need not start from scratch. Look at all files and scripts in
the configuration space. There are a lot of things you can use for
your own installation. A good paper called "Bootstrapping an
Infrastructure" with more aspects of building an infrastructure is
available at http://www.infrastructures.org/papers/bootstrap


== [[config]]Installation details

=== [[c3]]The configuration space

The configuration is the collection of information about how exactly
to install a computer. The central configuration space for all install
clients is located on the install server in '/srv/fai/config' and its
subdirectories. This will be mounted by the install clients to
'/var/lib/fai/config'. It's also possible to receive all the
configuration data from a `cvs(1)`, subversion (`svn(1)`) or Git
(`git(1)`) repository.  The following subdirectories are present and
include several files:

_class/_::
Scripts and files to
define classes and variables and to load kernel modules.

_disk_config/_::
Configuration files for disk partitioning and file system creation.

_debconf/_::
This directory holds all `debconf(8)` data. The format is the same
that is used by `debconf-set-selections(8)`.

_package_config/_::
Files with class names contain lists of software packages to be
installed or removed. Files named '*.asc' are added to the key list of
apt. 

_scripts/_::
Script for local site
customization.

_files/_::
Files used by customization scripts.  Most files are located in a
subtree structure which reflects the ordinary directory tree. For
example, the templates for 'nsswitch.conf' are located in
'$FAI/files/etc/nsswitch.conf' and are named according to the classes
that they should match: '$FAI/files/etc/nsswitch.conf/NIS' is the
version of '/etc/nsswitch.conf' to use for the NIS class.  Note that
the contents of the files directory are not automatically copied to
the target machine, rather they must be explicitly copied by
customization scripts using the `fcopy(8)` command.

_basefiles/_::
Normally the file '/var/tmp/base.tgz' is extracted on the install
client after the new file systems are created and before package are
installed. This is a minimal base image, created right after calling
debootstrap during the make-fai-nfsroot process on the install
server. If you want to install another distribution than the nfsroot
is, you can put a tar file into the subdirectory 'basefiles/' and name
it after a class. Then the command `ftar(8)` is used to extract the
tar file based on the classes defined. This is done in task
_extrbase_.

_hooks/_::
Hooks are user defined programs or scripts, which are called during
the installation process. The can extend or replace the default tasks.

The main installation command `fai(8)` uses all these subdirectories
in the order listed except for hooks. The FAI package contains
examples for all these configuration scripts and files in
'/usr/share/doc/fai-doc/examples'. Copy the configuration examples to
the configuration space and start an installation. These files need
not belong to the root account. You can change their ownership and
then edit the configuration with a normal user account.

----
# cp -a /usr/share/doc/fai-doc/examples/simple/* /srv/fai/config
# chown -R fai /srv/fai/config
----

These files contain simple configuration for some example
hosts. Depending on the host name used, your computer will be
configured as follows:

demohost::
A machine which needs only a small hard disk. This machine is
configured with network (as DHCP client), and an account demo is
created.

gnomehost::
A GNOME desktop is installed, and the account demo is created.

other host names::
Hosts with other host name will most notably use the classes FAIBASE,
DHCPC and GRUB.


Start looking at these examples and study them. Then change or add
things to these examples. But don't forget to plan your own
installation!

=== [[tasks]]The default tasks

After the kernel has booted, it mounts the root file system via NFS
from the install server and `init(8)` starts the script
'/usr/sbin/fai'. This script controls the sequence of the
installation. No other scripts in '/etc/init.d/' are used.

The installation script uses many subroutines, which are defined in
'/usr/lib/fai/subroutines'. All
important tasks of the installation are called via the subroutine
_task_ appended by the name of the task as an option
(e.g. __task_instsoft__). The subroutine _task_ calls hooks with prefix
*name* if available and then calls the default task (defined as
__task_<name>__ in 'subroutines'). The default task and its hooks can be
skipped on demand by using the subroutine _skiptask()_.

Now follows the description of all default tasks, listed in the order
they are executed.


confdir::
The kernel appended parameters define variables, the syslog and kernel
log daemon are started. The list of network devices is stored in
+$netdevices+. Then additional parameters are fetched from a DHCP
server and also additional variables are defined. The DNS 
resolver configuration file is created.
+
The location of the configuration space is defined by the variable
+$FAI_CONFIG_SRC+. You can use NFS, cvs, svn or git to access the
configuration space. See section <<isetup>> for how to set the
variable.
+
After that, the file '$FAI/hooks/subroutines' is sourced if it
exists. Using this file, you can define your own subroutines or
override the definition of FAI's subroutines.

////
MT: there is no info about that at id="isetup"
MT: config is also mounted/checked out in this task
////



setup::
This task sets the system time, all +$FAI_FLAGS+ are defined and two
additional virtual terminals are opened on demand. A secure shell
daemon is started on demand for remote logins.

defclass::
Calls `fai-class(1)` to define classes using scripts and files in
'$FAI/class' and classes from '/tmp/fai/additional-classes' and the
variable +$ADDCLASSES+.

defvar::
Sources all files '$FAI/class/*.var' for every defined class. If a
hook has written some variable definitions to the file
'/tmp/fai/additional.var', this file is also sourced.

action::
Depending on the value of +$FAI_ACTION+ this subroutine decides which
action FAI should perform. The default available actions are:
_sysinfo_, _install_ and _softupdate_.  If +$FAI_ACTION+ has another
value, a user defined action is called if a file
'$FAI/hooks/$FAI_ACTION' exists. So you can easily define your own
actions.


sysinfo::
Called when no installation is performed but the action is
_sysinfo_. It shows information about the detected hardware and mounts
the local hard disks read only to '/target/+partitionname+' or with
regard to a 'fstab' file found inside a partition. Log files are
stored to the install server.

install::
This task controls the installation sequence. You will hear three
beeps before the installation starts. The major work is to call other
tasks and to save the output to '/tmp/fai/fai.log'. If you have any
problems during installation, look at all files in '/tmp/fai/'. You
can find examples of the log files for some hosts in the download
directory of the FAI homepage.

softupdate::
This task, executed inside a running system via the `fai(8)` command
line interface, performs a softupdate.  See chapter <<softupdate>> for
details.

partition::
Calls `setup-storage(8)` to partition the hard
disks and to create file systems. The task writes variable definitions
for the root and boot partition and device (+$ROOT_PARTITION,
$BOOT_PARTITION, $BOOT_DEVICE+) to '/tmp/fai/disk_var.sh' and creates
an 'fstab' file.

mountdisks::
Mounts the created partitions according to the created
'/tmp/fai/fstab' file relative to +$FAI_ROOT+.

extrbase::
Extracts a minimal system after that a chroot can be made into it. By
default the base tar file '/var/tmp/base.tgz' will be extracted. The
command `ftar -1v -s $FAI/basefiles /` is used for unpacking a
different tar file depending on classes defined. This can be used for
installing different Linux distributions than the one used for
creating the nfsroot. The default file 'base.tgz' is a snapshot of a
basic Debian system created by `debootstrap(8)`

mirror::
If a local Debian mirror is accessed via NFS (when +$FAI_DEBMIRROR+ is
defined), this directory will be mounted to +$MNTPOINT+.

debconf::
Calls `fai-debconf(8)` to set the values for the debconf database.

repository::
Set up resolv.conf and some
other files, for the next task updatebase.

updatebase::
Updates the base packages of the new system and updates the list of
available packages. It also fakes some commands (called diversions)
inside the new installed system using `dpkg-divert(8)`.

instsoft::
Installs the desired software packages using class files in
'$FAI/package_config/'.

configure::
Calls scripts in '$FAI/scripts/' and its subdirectories for every
defined class.

tests::
Calls test scripts in '$FAI/tests/' and its subdirectories for every
defined class.

finish::
Unmounts all file systems in the new installed system and removes
diversions of files using the command `fai-divert`.

chboot::
Changes the PXE configuration for a host on the install server which
indicates which kernel image to load on the next boot from network
card via TFTP. Therefore the `fai-chboot(8)` command is executed
remotely on the install server.

savelog::
Saves log files to local disk and to the account +$LOGUSER+ on
+$LOGSERVER+ (defaults to the install server).

faiend::
Wait for background jobs to finish (e.g. emacs compiling lisp files)
and automatically reboots the install clients or waits for manual
input before reboot.



=== [[setuproutines]]The setup routines of the install clients

After the subroutine `fai_init` has done some basic initialization
(create RAM disk, read 'fai.conf' and all subroutines definitions, set
path, print copyright notice), the setup continues by calling the task
_confdir_ and the task _setup_. The command `get-boot-info` is called
to get all information from the DHCP server. This command
writes the file '/tmp/fai/boot.log', which then is sourced to define
the corresponding global variables. This is an example for this log
file when using a DHCP server.

include::includes/bootlog.txt[]

Additional information is passed via the kernel command line or read
from 'fai.conf'. When booting with PXE, command line parameters are
created using `fai-chboot(8)`.

If you do not boot from network card but from CD-ROM or USB stick, you
may also give network parameters to the kernel via the kernel command
line. Two interesting parameters are

----
nfsroot=<server-ip>:]<root-dir>[,<nfs-options>]

ip=<client-ip>:<server-ip>:<gw-ip>:<netmask>:<hostname>:<device>:<autoconf>
----

Those parameters are described in the documentation of the Linux
kernel sources in '/usr/src/linux/Documentation/nfsroot.txt'.


==== [[faiflags]]FAI flags

The variable +$FAI_FLAGS+ contains a space separated list of
flags. The following flags are known:

verbose::
Create verbose output during installation. This should always be the
first flag, so consecutive definitions of flags will be verbosely
displayed.

debug::
Create debug output. No unattended installation is performed. During
package installation you have to answer all questions of the
postinstall scripts on the client's console. A lot of debug
information will be printed out. This flag is only useful for FAI
developers.

sshd::
Start the ssh daemon to enable remote logins.

createvt::
Create two virtual terminals and execute a bash if _ctrl-c_ is typed
in the console terminal. The additional terminals can be accessed by
typing _Alt-F2_ or _Alt-F3_. Otherwise no terminals are available and
typing _ctrl-c_ will reboot the install client. Setting this flag is
useful for debugging. If you want an installation which should not be
interruptible, do not set this flag.

reboot::
Reboot the install client after installation is finished without
typing RETURN on the console. If this flag is not set, and error.log
contains anything, the install client will stop and wait that you
press RETURN. If no errors occurred, the client will always reboot
automatically. 

initial::
Used by `setup-storage(8)`. Partitions marked with +preserve_reinstall+
are preserved unless this flag is set. Often, this flag is set in a
file 'class/*.var' by using setting 'flag_initial=1'.


=== [[classc]]The class concept

////
MT: as marked above, this section should be put in chapter 1
////

Classes determine which configuration file to choose from a list of
available templates. Classes are used in all further tasks of the
installation. To determine which config file to use, an install client
searches the list of defined classes and uses all configuration files
that match a class name. It's also possible to use only the
configuration file with the highest priority since the order of
classes define the priority from low to high. There are some
predefined classes (DEFAULT, LAST and the host name), but classes can
also be listed in a file or defined dynamically by scripts. So it's
easy to define a class depending on the subnet information or on some
hardware that is available on the install client.

The idea of using classes in general and using certain files matching
a class name for a configuration is adopted from the installation
scripts by Casper Dik for Solaris. This technique proved to be very
useful for the SUN workstations, so I also use it for the fully
automatic installation of Linux. One simple and very efficient feature
of Casper's scripts is to call a command with all files (or on the
first one) whose file names are also a class. The following loop
implements this function in pseudo shell code:

----
for class in $all_classes; do
if [ -r $config_dir/$class ]; then
   your_command $config_dir/$class
   # exit if only the first matching file is needed
fi
done
----

Therefore it is possible to add a new file to the configuration
without changing the script. This is because the loop automatically
detects new configuration files that should be used. Unfortunately
cfengine does not support this nice feature, so all classes being used
in cfengine also need to be specified inside the cfengine
scripts. Classes are very important for the fully automatic
installation. If a client belongs to class _A_, we say the class _A_
is defined. A class has no value, it is just defined or
undefined. Within scripts, the variable +$classes+ holds a space
separated list with the names of all defined classes.  Classes
determine how the installation is performed. For example, an install
client can be configured to become an FTP server by just adding the
class _FTP_ to it.

Mostly a configuration is created by only changing or appending the
classes to which a client belongs, making the installation of a new
client very easy. Thus no additional information needs to be added to
the configuration files if the existing classes suffice for your
needs.  There are different possibilities to define classes:

. Some default classes are defined for every host:     DEFAULT, LAST and its host name.
. Classes may be listed within a file.
. Classes may be defined by scripts.

The last option is a very nice feature, since these scripts will
define classes automatically. For example, several classes are defined
only if certain hardware is identified. We use Perl and shell scripts
to define classes. All names of classes, except the host name, are
written in uppercase. They must not contain a hyphen, a hash or a dot,
but may contain underscores. A description of all classes can be found
in '/usr/share/doc/fai-doc/classes_description.txt'.

Host names should rarely be used for the configuration files in the
configuration space. Instead, a class should be defined and then added
for a given host. This is because most of the time the configuration
data is not specific for one host, but can be shared among several
hosts.

=== [[s2]]Defining classes

The task _defclass_ calls the script `fai-class(1)` to define
classes. Therefore, scripts matching _[0-9][0-9]*_ in _$FAI/class_ are
executed. Additionally, a file with the host name may contain a list
of classes.  For more information on defining class, read the manual
pages for `fai-class(1)`.

The list of all defined classes is stored in the variable +$classes+
and saved to '/tmp/fai/FAI_CLASSES'. The list of all classes is
transferred to `cfengine`, so it can use them too. The script
'10-base-classes' (below is a stripped version) is used to define
classes depending on the host name. First, this script defines the
class with the name of the hardware architecture in uppercase letters.

----
10-base-classes:

# echo architecture and OS name in upper case. Do NOT remove these two lines
uname -s | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'
dpkg --print-architecture | tr /a-z/ /A-Z/

[ -f /etc/RUNNING_FROM_FAICD ] && echo "FAICD"

# use a list of classes for our demo machine
case $HOSTNAME in
    demohost)
        echo "FAIBASE GRUB DHCPC DEMO" ;;
    gnomehost)
        echo "FAIBASE GRUB DHCPC DEMO XORG GNOME";;
    *)
        echo "FAIBASE GRUB DHCPC" ;;
esac
----

The script _20-hwdetect.source_ uses the default Debian commands to
detect hardware and to load some kernel modules. If some specific
hardware is found, it can also define a new class for it.  You can
find messages from modprobe in '/tmp/fai/kernel.log' and on the fourth
console terminal by pressing _Alt-F4_.

=== [[classvariables]]Defining variables

The task _defvar_ defines the variables for the install
client. Variables are defined by scripts in _class/*.var_. All global
variables can be set in 'DEFAULT.var'. For certain groups of hosts use
a class file or for a single host use the file +$HOSTNAME+_.var_. Also
here, it's useful to study all the examples.

The following variables are used in the examples and may also be
useful for your installation:

FAI_ACTION::
Set the action FAI should perform. Normally this is done by
`fai-chboot(8)`. If you can't use this command, define it in the
script 'LAST.var'.

FAI_ALLOW_UNSIGNED::
If set to 1, FAI allows the installation of packages from unsigned
repositories.

CONSOLEFONT::
Is the font which is loaded during installation by `consolechars(8)`.

KEYMAP::
Defines the keyboard map files in '/usr/share/keymaps' and
'$FAI/files'. You need not specify the complete path, since this file
will be located automatically.

ROOTPW::
The encrypted root password for the new system. You can use `crypt(3)`
or md5 encryption for the password. You can create the encrypted
password using `mkpasswd(1)`. See <<hints,chapter various hints>> for
more info.

UTC::
Set hardware clock to UTC if _$UTC=yes_. Otherwise set clock to local
time. See `clock(8)` for more information.

TIMEZONE::
Is the file relative to '/usr/share/zoneinfo/' which indicates your
time zone.

MODULESLIST:::
Can be a multi line definition. List of modules (including kernel
parameters) which are loaded during boot of the new system (written to
/etc/modules).


=== [[diskconfig]]Hard disk configuration

Read the manual page of `setup-storage(8)` for a detailed description
of the new format. This is used by default since FAI 3.2.8.


=== [[packageconfig]]Software package configuration

////
MT: This section is pretty much a chaos:
which commands belong to which package tools
you say something about PRELOADRM and PRELOAD commands, but give no example
and don't list them otherwise
////


Before installing packages, FAI will add the content of all files
named _package_config/*.asc_ to the list of apt keys. If your local
repository is signed by your keyid AB12CD34 you can easily add this key,
so FAI will use it during installation. Use this command for creating
the '.asc' file:

----
faiserver$ gpg -a --export AB12CD34 > /srv/fai/config/package_config/myrepo.asc
----


The script `install_packages(8)` installs the selected software
packages. It uses all configuration files in '$FAI/package_config'
whose file name matches a defined class. The syntax is very simple.

----
# an example package class

PACKAGES taskinst
german 

PACKAGES aptitude
adduser netstd ae
less passwd

PACKAGES remove
gpm xdm

PACKAGES aptitude GRUB
lilo- grub

PACKAGES dselect-upgrade
ddd                     install
a2ps                    install
----

Comments are starting with a hash (#) and are ending at the end of the
line. Every command begins with the word _PACKAGES_ followed by a
command name. The command defines which command will be used to
install the packages named after this command. The list of all
available commands can be listed using _install_packages -H_.
Supported package tools are: _aptitude, apt-get, smart, y2pmsh, yast,
yum, urpm, rpm_

hold::
Put a package on hold. This package will not be handled by dpkg, e.g
not upgraded.

install::
Install all packages that are specified in the following lines. If a
hyphen is appended to the package name (with no intervening space),
the package will be removed, not installed. All package names are
checked for misspellings.  Any package which does not exist, will be
removed from the list of packages to install. So be careful not to
misspell any package names.

remove::
Remove all packages that are specified in the following lines. Append
a + to the package name if the package should be installed.

taskinst::
Install all packages belonging to the tasks that are specified in the
following lines using `tasksel(1)`. You can also use _aptitude_ for
installing tasks.

aptitude::
Install all packages with the command `aptitude`. This will be the
default in the future and may replace apt-get and taskinst. Aptitude
can also install task packages.

aptitude-r::
Same as aptitude with option _--with-recommends_.

unpack::
Download package and unpack only. Do not configure the package.

dselect-upgrade::
Set package selections using the following lines and install or remove
the packages specified. These lines are the output of the command
_dpkg --get-selections_.


Multiple lines with lists of space separated names of packages follow
the PACKAGES lines. All dependencies are resolved. Packages with
suffix _-_ (eg. _lilo-_) will be removed instead of installed. The
order of the packages is of no matter.  If you like to install
packages from another release than the default, you can append the
release name to the package name like in
_openoffice.org/etch-backports_. You can also specify a certain
version like _apt=0.3.1_. More information on these features are
described in `aptitude(8)`.

A line which contains the _PRELOADRM_ commands, downloads a file using
`wget(1)` into a directory before installing the packages. Using the
_file:_ URL, this file is copied from +$FAI_ROOT+ to the download
directory.  For example the package `realplayer` needs an archive to
install the software, so this archive is downloaded to the directory
'/root'. After installing the packages this file will be removed. If
the file shouldn't be removed, use the command _PRELOAD_ instead.

It's possible to append a list of class names after the command for
apt-get. So this _PACKAGE_ command will only be executed when the
corresponding class is defined. So you can combine many small files
into the file DEFAULT. WARNING! Use this feature only in the file
DEFAULT to keep everything simple. See this file for some examples.

If you want to remove a package name from a certain class was part of
this class before, you should not remove the package name from the
class file, but instead append a dash (-) to it. This will make sure
that the package is remove during a softupdate on hosts which were
installed using the old class definition which included this package
name.

If you specify a package that does not exist this package will be
removed from the installation list when the command _install_ is used.

=== [[cscripts]] Customization scripts in _$FAI/scripts_

The default set of scripts in '$FAI/scripts' is only an example. But
they should do a reasonable job for your installation. You can edit
them or add new scripts to match your local needs.

The command `fai-do-scripts(1)` is called to execute all scripts in
this directory. If a directory with a class name exists, all scripts
matching '[0-9][0-9]*' are executed in alphabetical order. So it's
possible to use scripts of different languages (shell, cfengine,
Perl,..) for one class.

==== [[shell]]Shell scripts

Most scripts are Bourne shell scripts. Shell scripts are useful if the
configuration task only needs to call some shell commands or create a
file from scratch. In order not to write many short scripts, it's
possible to distinguish classes within a script using the command
_ifclass_. For copying files with classes, use the command
`fcopy(8)`. If you want to extract an archive using classes, use
`ftar(8)`.  But now have a look at the scripts and see what they are
doing.

==== [[perl]]Perl scripts
Currently no Perl script are used in the simple examples for modifying
the system configuration.

==== [[expect]]Expect scripts
Currently no expect scripts are used in the simple examples for
modifying the system configuration.

==== [[cfengine]]Cfengine scripts

Cfengine has a rich set of functions to edit existing configuration
files, e.g _LocateLineMatching, ReplaceAll, InsertLine,
AppendIfNoSuchLine, HashCommentLinesContaining_. But it can't handle
variables which are undefined. If a variable is undefined, the whole
cfengine script will abort. Study the examples that are included in
the FAI package.

More information can be found in the manual page `cfengine(8)` or at
the cfengine homepage http://www.cfengine.org.


=== [[changeboot]]Changing the boot device

Changing the boot sequence is normally done in the BIOS setup. But you
can't change the BIOS from a running Linux system as far as I know. If
you know how to perform this, please send me an email. But there's
another way of swapping the boot device of a running Linux system.

////
MT: recently, there has been some discussion on linux-fai, add a link to the
archives
////

So, normally the boot sequence of the BIOS will remain unchanged and
your computer should always boot first from its network card and the
second boot device should be the local disk. Then, it will get an
install kernel image from the install server, when an installation
should be performed, or we can tell pxelinux to boot from local
disk. This is done using `fai-chboot(8)`.

Here is how to set up a 3Com network card as first boot device.
Enable LAN as first boot device in the BIOS.

 Boot From LAN First: Enabled
 Boot Sequence      : C only

Then enter the MBA setup of the 3Com network card and change it as follows:

 Default Boot           Local
 Local Boot             Enabled
 Message Timeout        3 Seconds
 Boot Failure Prompt    Wait for timeout
 Boot Failure           Next boot device

This will enable the first IDE hard disk as second boot device after
the network card.

=== [[hooks]]Hooks

Hooks let you specify functions or programs which are run at certain
steps of the installation process. Before a default task is called,
FAI searches for existing hooks for this task and executes them. As
you might expect, classes are also used when calling hooks. Hooks are
executed for every defined class. You only have to create the hook
with the name for the desired class and it will be used.  If several
hooks for a task exists, they are called in the order defined by the
classes.  If _debug_ is included in +$FAI_FLAG+ the option _-d_ is
passed to all hooks, so you can debug your own hooks.  If some default
tasks should be skipped, use the subroutine _skiptask_ and a list of
default tasks as parameters. The hooks of the class CENTOS skips
some default tasks.

The directory '$FAI/hooks/' contains all hooks. A hook is an executable
file following the naming scheme 'taskname.CLASSNAME[.source]' (e.g.
'partition.DISKLESS' or 'partition.DISKLESS.source'), a task name and a
class name separated by a dot, optionally followed by '.source'. The
task name specifies which task to precede executing this hook, if the
specified class is defined for the installing client.  See section
<<tasks>> for a complete list of default tasks that can be used.

In our example, the hook 'partition.DISKLESS' is called for every
client belonging to the class _DISKLESS_ before the local disks would
be partitioned. If it should become a diskless client, this hook can
mount remote file systems via NFS and create a _/tmp/fai/fstab_.  After
that, the installation process will not try to partition and format a
local hard disk, because a file '/tmp/fai/fstab' already exists.

A hook of the form _hookprefix.classname_ can't define variables for
the installation script, because it's a subprocess. But you can use
any binary executable or any script you wrote. Hooks that have the
suffix _.source_ (e.g. 'partition.DEFAULT.source') must be Bourne
shell scripts and are sourced. So it's possible to redefine variables
for the installation scripts.

In the first part of FAI, all hooks with prefix _confdir_ are called.
Since the configuration directory '$FAI' is mounted in the default
task _confdir_, the hooks for this task are the only hooks located in
+$nfsroot+'/$FAI/hooks' on the install server. All other hooks are
found in '$FAI_CONFIGDIR/hooks' on the install server.

////
MT: what about softupdate?
////


All hooks that are called before classes are defined can only use the
following classes: _DEFAULT $HOSTNAME LAST_. If a hook for class
_DEFAULT_ should only be called if no hook for class +$HOSTNAME+ is
available, insert these lines to the default hook:

----
hookexample.DEFAULT:

#! /bin/sh

# skip DEFAULT hook if a hook for $HOSTNAME exists
scriptname=$(basename $0 .DEFAULT)
[-f $FAI/hooks/$scriptname.$HOSTNAME ] && exit
# here follows the actions for class DEFAULT
.
.
----

Some examples for what hooks could be used:

- Use `ssh` in the very beginning to verify that you mounted the
configuration from the correct server and not a possible spoofing
host.

- Do not mount the configuration directory, instead get a compressed
archive via HTTP and extract it into a new RAM disk, then redefine
+$FAI_LOCATION+.

- Load kernel modules before classes are defined in '$FAI/class'.

- Send an email to the administrator if the installation is finished.

- Install a diskless client and skip local disk partitioning. See
'hooks/partition.DISKLESS'.


=== [[errors]]Looking for errors

If the client can't successfully boot from the network card, use
`tcpdump(8)` to look for Ethernet packets between the install server
and the client. Search also for entries in several log files made by
`tftpd(8)` and `dhcpd3(8)` :

----
faiserver$ egrep "tftpd|dhcpd" /var/log/*
----

Sometimes the installation seems to stop, but often there's only a
postinstall script of a software package that requires manual input
from the console. Change to another virtual terminal and look which
process is running with tools like `top(1)` and `pstree(1)`. You can
add _debug_ to _FAI_FLAGS_ to make the installation process show all
output from the postinst scripts on the console and get its input also
from the console. Don't hesitate to send an email to the mailing list
or to mailto:fai@fai-project.org[] if you have any
questions. Sample log files from successfully installed computers are
available on the FAI homepage.

=== [[logfiles]]Log files

FAI is creating several log files. During installation they are stored
in '/tmp/fai' on the install client itself. At the end of the
installation they will be copied to the install server (see
<<isavelog>>). After the install client rebooted into his newly
installed system, you can find the FAI logs in '/var/log/fai'.
Log files are also created when doing the softupdate or dirinstall
action. 

These a some log files which are created by FAI.

FAI_CLASSES::
Contains a list of all classes defined.

dmesg.log::
Output of the `dmesg` command. Contains useful messages of the kernel
ring buffer.

fai.log::
The main log file. Contains all important information. You should
always read this file.

boot.log::
A list of variables of network parameters, mostly defined by the DHCP daemon.

format.log::
Output of the partition tool `setup-storage(8)`.

shell.log::
Output of all shell scripts, that are used for customization.

variables.log::
A list of all shell variables which are available during an
installation.

error.log::
A summary of possible errors in all log files.

If the installation process finishes, the hook 'savelog.LAST.source'
searches all log files for common errors and writes them to the file
'error.log'. So, you should first look into this file for errors. Also
the file 'status.log' give you the exit code of the last command
executed in a script. To be sure, you should look for more details in
all log files.


== [[beowulf]]How to build a Beowulf cluster using FAI

This chapter describes the details about building a Beowulf cluster
using Debian/GNU Linux and FAI. This chapter was written for FAI
version 2.x for Debian woody and was not yet updated. The example
configuration files were removed from the FAI packages after FAI
2.8.4.

For more information about the Beowulf concept look at
http://www.beowulf.org.

=== [[beoplan]]Planning the Beowulf setup

The example of a Beowulf cluster consists of one master node and 25
clients. A big rack was assembled which all the cases were put into. A
keyboard and a monitor, which are connected to the master server most
of the time, were also put into the rack. But since we have very long
cables for a monitor and a keyboard, they can also be connected to all
nodes if something has to be changed in the BIOS, or when looking for
errors when a node does not boot. Power supply is another topic you
have to think about. Don't connect many nodes to one power cord and
one outlet. Distribute them among several breakout boxes and outlets.
And what about the heat emission? A dozen nodes in a small room can
create too much heat, so you will need an air conditioner. Will the
power supplies of each node go to stand-by mode or are all nodes
turned on simultaneously after a power failure?

All computers in this example are connected to a Fast Ethernet
switch. The master node (or master server) is called _nucleus_. It has
two network cards. One for the connection to the external Internet,
one for the connection to the internal cluster network. If connected
from the external Internet, it's called _nucleus_, but the cluster
nodes access the master node with the name _atom00_, which is a name
for the second network interface. The master server is also the
install server for the computing nodes. A local Debian mirror will be
installed on the local hard disk. The home directories of all user
accounts are also located on the master server. It will be exported
via NFS to all computing nodes. NIS will be used to distribute
account, host, and printer information to all nodes.

All client nodes _atom01_ to _atom25_ are connected via the switch
with the second interface card of the master node. They can only
connect to the other nodes or the master, but can't communicate to any
host outside their cluster network. So, all services (NTP, DNS, NIS,
NFS, ...) must be available on the master server. I chose the class C
network address _192.168.42.0_ for building the local Beowulf cluster
network. You can replace the subnet 42 with any other number you
like. If you have more than 253 computing nodes, choose a class A
network address (10.X.X.X).

In the phase of preparing the installation, you have to boot the first
install client many times, until there's no fault in your
configuration scripts. Therefore you should have physical access to
the master server and one client node. So, connect both computers to a
switch box, so one keyboard and monitor can be shared among both.


=== [[master]]Set up the master server

The master server will be installed by hand if it is your first
computer installed with Debian. If you already have a host running
Debian, you can also install the master server via FAI. Create a
partition on '/files/scratch/debmirror' for the local Debian mirror
with more than {mirrorsize} GB space available.

==== [[beonetworkmaster]]Set up the network

Add the following lines for the second network card to
'/etc/network/interfaces':

----
# Beowulf cluster connection
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
address 192.168.42.250
netmask 255.255.255.0
broadcast 192.168.42.255
----

Add the IP addresses for the client nodes. The FAI package has an
example for this '/etc/hosts' file:

----
# create these entries with the Perl one liner
# perl -e 'for (1..25) {printf "192.168.42.%s atom%02s\n",$_,$_;}'

# Beowulf nodes
# atom00 is the master server
192.168.42.250 atom00
192.168.42.1 atom01
192.168.42.2 atom02
----

You can give the internal Beowulf network a name when you add this
line to '/etc/networks':

  beowcluster 192.168.42.0


Activate the second network interface with: _/etc/init.d/networking start_.

==== [[beonis]]Setting up NIS

Add a normal user account +tom+ which is the person who edits
the configuration space and manages the local Debian mirror:

  # adduser tom
  # addgroup linuxadmin

This user should also be in the group +linuxadmin+.

  # adduser tom linuxadmin

First, set the NIS domainname name by creating the file
'/etc/defaultdomain' and call `domainname(8)`.  To initialize the
master server as NIS server call _/usr/lib/yp/ypinit -m_.  Also edit
'/etc/default/nis' so the host becomes a NIS master server.  Then,
copy the file 'netgroup' from the examples directory to '/etc' and
edit other files there. Adjust access to the NIS service.

----
/etc/ypserv.securenets:

# Always allow access for localhost
255.0.0.0       127.0.0.0
# This line gives access to the Beowulf cluster
255.255.255.0 192.168.42.0
----

Rebuild the NIS maps:

----
master# cd /var/yp; make
----

You will find much more information about NIS in the
'NIS-HOWTO' document.

==== [[beomirror]]Create a local Debian mirror

Now the user +tom+ can create a local Debian mirror on
'/files/scratch/debmirror' using `mkdebmirror`. You can add the option
_--debug_ to see which files are received. This will need about 250 GB
disk space for Debian 3.0 (aka woody). Export this directory to the
netgroup _@faiclients_ read only.  Here's the line for '/etc/exports':

 /files/scratch/debmirror *(ro)

==== [[fai1]]Install FAI package on the master server

Add the following packages to the install server:

----
nucleus:/# apt-get install ntp tftpd-hpa dhcp3-server \
  nfs-kernel-server etherwake fai
nucleus:/# tasksel -q -n install dns-server
nucleus:/# apt-get dselect-upgrade
----

Configure NTP so that the master server will have the correct system time.


It's very important to use the internal network name +atom00+ for the
master server (not the external name +nucleus+) in
'/etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf' and 'make-fai-nfsroot.conf'. Replace the
strings FAISERVER with _atom00_ and uncomment the following line in
'make-fai-nfsroot.conf' so the Beowulf nodes can use the name for
connecting to their master server.

----
NFSROOT_ETC_HOSTS="192.168.42.250 atom00"
----

==== [[bootp1]]Prepare network booting

Set up the install server daemon as described in <<pxeboot>>. If you
will have many cluster nodes (more than about 10) and you will use
_rsh_ in 'fai.conf' raise the number of connects per minute to some
services in 'inetd.conf':

----
 shell stream tcp  nowait.300  root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/in.rshd
 login stream tcp  nowait.300  root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/in.rlogind
----

The user +tom+ should have permission to create the
symlinks for booting via network card, so change the group and add
some utilities.


----
# chgrp -R linuxadmin /srv/tftp/fai; chmod -R g+rwx /srv/tftp/fai
# cp /usr/share/doc/fai-doc/examples/utils/* /usr/local/bin
----

Now, the user +tom+ sets the boot image for the first beowulf
node.

----
$ fai-chboot -IFv atom01
----

Now boot the first client node for the first time. Then start to
adjust the configuration for your client nodes.

=== [[beotools]]Tools for Beowulf clusters

The following tools are useful for a Beowulf cluster:

all_hosts::
Print a list of all hosts, print only the hosts which respond to a
ping or the hosts which do not respond. The complete list of hosts is
defined by the netgroup _allhosts_. Look at
'/usr/share/doc/fai-doc/examples/etc/netgroup' for an example.

rshall::
Execute a command on all hosts which are up via rsh. Uses `all_hosts`
to get the list of all hosts up. You can also use the `dsh(1)` command
(dancer's shell, or distributed shell).

rup::
The command `rup(1)` shows briefly the CPU load of every host.

clusterssh::
The package clusterssh allows you to control multiple ssh or rsh
sessions at the same time.

These are some common tools for a cluster environment:

rgang::
For a huge cluster try `rgang`. It's is a tool which executes commands
on or distributes files to many nodes. It uses an algorithm to build a
tree-like structure to allow the distribution processing time to scale
very well to 1000 or more nodes (available at
http://fermitools.fnal.gov/abstracts/rgang/abstract.html).

jmon::
For observing the resources of all clients (CPU, memory, swap,...)
you can use `jmon(1)` which installs a simple daemon on every cluster
node.

ganglia::
This toolkit is very good for monitoring your cluster with a nice web
frontend. Available at http://ganglia.sourceforge.net

=== [[wol]]Wake on LAN with 3Com network cards

Wake on LAN is a very nice feature to power on a computer without
having physical access to it. By sending a special ethernet packet to
the network card, the computer will be turned on. The following things
have to be done, to use the wake on LAN (WOL) feature.

. Connect the network card to the Wake-On-LAN connector on the
motherboard using a 3 pin cable.
. My ASUS K7M motherboard has a jumper called
_Vaux (3VSBSLT)_ which allows to select the voltage supplied to add-in
PCI cards. Set it to _Add 3VSB_ (3 Volt stand by).
. Turn on the wake on LAN feature in BIOS
. For a 3Com card using the 3c59x driver you must enable the
WOL feature using the kernel module option _enable_wol_.

To wake up a computer use the command `etherwake(8)`.

== [[arch]]FAI on other architectures
If you want to use FAI on other architectures than i386 or amd64 you
might need to take care of some things yourself.

These are things that may have to be changed on other architectures:

Boot loader::
There are scripts for setting up `grub(8)`. Here you may
add support for your specific boot loader.

If you want to serve multiple nfsroot directories on one FAI server,
you need to create specific config directories in '/etc' for FAI, like
'/etc/fai-sarge' and '/etc/fai-etch'. Then you need to set the
+$NFSROOT+ variables to different directories and run

----
faiserver#make-fai-nfsroot -c /etc/fai-sarge
----

=== [[archcross]]How to install i386 systems from an amd64 system

To install a computer with a 32bit i386 system, you need an i386 nfsroot.
Creating this 32bit nfsroot on an install server runnning amd64 is
quite simple. Install and set up the FAI packages. Then copy your FAI
config files to a new subdirectory.

----
faiserver# cp -a /etc/fai /etc/fai-i386
----

Edit the variable +$FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP_OPTS+ in
'/etc/fai-i386/make-fai-nfsroot.conf' and add the option +--arch
i386+. Also choose a different directory for your new nfsroot. Here 
are the two lines after editing.

----
NFSROOT=/srv/fai/nfsroot-i386
FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP_OPTS="--arch i386 --exclude=info"
----

Now call make-fai-nfsroot which creates the 32bit i386 nfsroot in
'/srv/fai/nfsroot-i386'

----
faiserver# make-fai-nfsroot -v -C/etc/fai-i386
----

Creating a partitial mirror using `fai-mirror(1)` that is needed for
a bootable CD or USB stick is also possible on a different architecture.
Due to a bug in apt-move (#441231), you have to specify the
architecture when calling fai-mirror.

----
$ export MAXPACKAGES=800
$ fai-mirror -a i386 -v -cDEFAULT,FAIBASE,I386 /srv/mirror-i386
----

That's all!


=== [[powerpc]]FAI on PowerPC
There's some stuff on http://www.layer-acht.org/fai.  Most notably
there are hooks for partitioning and config-files to set up bootloaders
for oldworld and newworld.

=== [[ia64]]FAI on IA64
There's one big IA64 Beowulf cluster running which was installed with
FAI. Only the partitioning part has to be replaced by a short script,
since sfdisk is not available on IA64. This should not be need any
more since the partitioning tool `setup-storage(8)` works on all
architectures, were parted is supported.


=== [[otherbase]]Installing other distributions using a Debian nfsroot

You can install all sorts of Linux distributions from a single Debian
nfsroot. Therefore you have to create a base.tgz of the distribution
you like to install and place it info the `basefiles` directory. Then
name it UBUNTU910.tar.gz for example. An install client which belongs
to the class UBUNTU910 then extracts this base file into its empty
file system. Additionally you have to adjust the 'sources.list' or
similar configuration files which are needed for specifying the
location of the package repository.

=== [[odists]]FAI for Ubuntu, Suse, Redhat and Gentoo
All FAI packages are available in Ubuntu and are used by a large
number of people since many version.

Many people are interested in FAI for other (mostly RPM based) Linux
distributions. I made some research and it should not be much work to
implement it. But I need more help to implement it. If you are
interested and would like to help me, please send an email to
mailto:fai@fai-project.org[].

A brief description how to install SLES9 with FAI is available at
http://www.sourcecode.de/install_sles_with_fai.

There are also some information in the faiwiki.

=== [[sparc]]FAI on SUN SPARC hardware running Linux

Although FAI is architecture independent, there are some packages
which are only available for certain architectures (e.g. silo,
sparc-utils).

SUN SPARC computers can boot from their boot prompt. To boot a SUN
use:

  boot net:dhcp - ip=::::::dhcp


You have to convert the kernel image from ELF format to a.out
format. Use the program `elftoaout` (mentioned in the FAQ). The
symlink to the kernel image to be booted is not the host name.

A success report as of 2001 is available at http://www.opossum.ch/fai/.

=== [[solaris]]FAI for Solaris

FAI has also been ported for use with SUN Solaris OS installations in
cooperation with Solaris jumpstart. This was done using FAI 2.8.4 and
Solaris 9. Get the FAI sources from FAI 2.8.4 and change to the
'sunos' directory. There you can call _make_ which creates the tarball
'/tmp/fai-solaris.tar.gz'. You have to read the file 'README.sunos'
and have some knowledge about Solaris jumpstart. The Solaris support
was removed in FAI 2.9.

The file format of the configuration files in 'disk_config' and
'package_config' are different than those for Linux.

== [[advanced]]Advanced FAI

=== [[dirinstall]]Creating chroot and virtualization environments 

If you have some chroot environments to install, or a virtualization
environment where you neither can nor want to run a normal Debian
Installer in to get to a working system (for example, Xen guest
domains), there is the FAI action _dirinstall_.
By calling 

----
faiserver# fai <options> dirinstall <target-directory>
----

and using either the option _-c <classes>_ or _-N_ you get a FAI
installation, without the partitioning action, right into the target
directory. The host name for the target installation can be specified
using _-u <host-name>_

This, for example, can be used to combine FAI with the tool
_xen-tools_, which helps you to build Xen guest domains. _xen-tools_
are very nice for generating configuration files and block devices for
new guests based on simple commands and/or configuration files, but
they can only assign one role per installation for customization.
FAI-users need and want more, as they are used to have the class
system.  They get them even in xen-tools installations, by using the
following code as a xen-tools role script:

----
#!/bin/sh
TARGET=$1
CMD="fai -N  -v -u ${hostname} dirinstall $TARGET"
echo running $CMD
$CMD
----

Then, you will want to set the variable _install=0_ the xen-tools
config for that host (in previous versions of xen-tools, this was
_no-install=1_).

=== [[softupdate]]Using FAI for updates
FAI is even usable for system updates, using the same configuration as
if initially installing. System update means updating the running
system without doing a re-installation. An updated client will almost
look like a newly installed machine, though all local data is
preserved (except of course newer configuration files introduced in
the FAI config).

==== [[aboutsoftupdate]]How does a softupdate work?

Softupdate use the same configuration files as a new FAI
installation. They even use the default FAI commands, so they behave
_nearly_ in the same way as an installation, though some things are
different:

* By default the old list of classes (created during the initial
installation) is used, so `fai-class` is not called to define a new
list of classes. This can be changed by calling _fai -N softupdate_.

* No partitioning and file system creation is performed.
* The basesytem isn't bootstrapped.
* FAI skips tasks only useful when installing, such as setting up
	a keymap or starting special daemons.
* FAI doesn't prevent software packages to (re-)start daemons.
* FAI doesn't reboot at the end of a softupdate.

Except these changes, things are the same as when installing a new computer: 

. Define classes (by default use old list) and variables.
. Update the installed packages.
. Install new software.
. Call configuration scripts.
. Save the logfiles.

==== [[runsoftupdate]]How to run a softupdate

As softupdate use the same infrastructure as a FAI installation, you
even start them by using the same command `fai(8)` which is used for
installation:

----
# fai -v softupdate
----

starts a softupdate.
Make sure to set the variable +$LOGSERVER+ (done in a _class/*.var_
file) if FAI should save the log files to a remote machine.

===== How to do mass softupdates
Probably you don't want to run to each client and start a softupdate
there locally, so a mechanism to start an update there has to be
thought of.

===== Cron
One possible solution is to use crontab entries on the clients to
start an update, but in big installations you have to consider
including a random-delay mechanism, because too many updates at the
same time may produce too much traffic on your network.

===== Starting a softupdate remotely
If you want more control when exactly a softupdate is run on the
clients and maybe want to monitor it while it is running, you can
install remote root login mechanisms on your clients, preferably using
ssh in connection with a authorized key for root logins.

Tools like _clusterssh_ allow you to login onto a group of clients at
once and run _fai softupdate_ there, while the results can be seen
immediately in the terminals started for each host.


==== [[confsoftupdate]]How to write a configuration suitable for softupdate
When you want to do softupdate, you have to be even more careful when
writing your configuration: it has to be *idempotent*, i.e.  running
all the scripts twice should result in the same system configuration
as running them once. Some things to keep an eye on:


- *Never* blindly append to files:

  $ echo $SOMETHING >> /etc/fstab

is almost certainly wrong. Either check manually if the line already
exists *before* appending or use the command `ainsl(1)`. This has a
similar function to cfengine's _AppendIfNoSuchLine_ statement

- Make use of FAI's environment variables to determine what to do in
		your configuration scripts! Some of the most important ones:


+$FAI_CONFIG_SRC+::
is the URI of the configuration space.

+$FAI_ROOT+::
points to the client's rootdir. In case of softupdate it's the root
directory _/_

+$ROOTCMD+::
contains a command for _chrooting_
into the client. This is empty when doing
softupdate (as _/_ is already our root...).

+$FAI_ACTION+::
contains the currently executed action:
 * _install_ when installing.
 * _softupdate_ when updating

- Restart daemons if needed: most daemons only read their
configuration when starting; if you modify it, you need to
make them reload it using

....
	$ROOTCMD invoke-rc.d $somedaemon reload
....
or even restart them

....
	$ROOTCMD invoke-rc.d $somedaemon restart
....
when the configuration for _$somedaemon_ has been changed
footnote:[You can for example use `fcopy(8)`'s _postinst_ script
support for doing this; if other things than _fcopy_ modify your
conffiles, you have to keep track of the changes yourself.]

- Other things like scheduling a reboot if a new kernel is installed

==== [[localconfsoftupdate]]What if there are locally changed config files?

*Short: there shouldn't be any!*

*Long:* _if_ you are using FAI _softupdate_ to update client's
configuration, you shouldn't do any local changes on the install
clients, because they may be lost while updating. Backup copies are
done by fcopy only on the local disk. By default, they are written to
the same directory as the original file, with _.pre_fcopy_ appended.
If you want to save them together with the logfiles,
add following line to your _class/DEFAULT.var_:
....
FAI_BACKUPDIR=$LOGDIR/backup
....

==== [[detectlocalchanges]]How to detect locally changed files?

If you are playing with local configuration changes _despite all the
warnings contained in this section_, there must be a way to check what
has been changed locally. A simple approach would be to use _debsums
-e_, but this method fails miserably if you modify conffiles in your
FAI scripts, because it only checks against the version contained in
the Debian package. A better proposal is to set up/abuse `tripwire(8)` or
`integrit(1)` to scan for local changes and notify you about them.


== [[hints]]Various hints

This chapter has various hints which may not always be explained in great
detail.

- To generate a md5 hash for the password use this
_echo "yoursecrectpassword" | mkpasswd -Hmd5 -s_

- When using HTTP access to a Debian mirror, the local _/var_ partition
on all install clients must be big enough to keep the downloaded
Debian packages. Do not try with less than 250 Mbytes unless you know
why. You can limit the number of packages installed at a time with the
variable +$MAXPACKAGES+.

- You can remove the red logo on the install client by simply calling
`reset` once. If will also not appear if you create a file using this
command on the install server:

----
touch /srv/fai/nfsroot/live/filesystem.dir/.nocolorlogo
----

- If you like to define some additional classes (for e.g. A,B,C) on the
kernel command line add this: _ADDCLASSES=A,B,C_

- You can shorten some scripts by using one single fcopy
command _fcopy -r /_.

- If you rebuild the nfsroot, you will create a new ssh host key inside
the nfsroot. Then logging in to an install client may fail, because
the host key changes. You can use this:

----
$ ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no root@installclient
----

- You can also delete the host entry on your install client in your
_~/.ssh/known_hosts_ file by using the _ssh-keygen -R_ command.

- In the tasks chboot and savelog, a connection using secure shell is
opened to the FAI server (see <<isavelog>>). To ensure that this works
non-interactively, a proper entry in 'NFSROOT/root/.ssh/known_hosts'
must be created. When using fai-setup, this is done automatically, but
it may require manual editing in case the name of your FAI server was
not determined correctly.  If you stumble over ssh connections that
require typing "yes" to accept the host key during installation,
please check the contents of your 'NFSROOT/root/.ssh/known_hosts file'

- You can calculate the IP subnet address by using the
nice tool ipcalc. Following example gives you the notation for a class
C network (24) when the server network interface has the IP address
123.45.6.123

----
$ ipcalc -nb 123.45.6.123 24|grep Network:
----

- You can merge two directories which contain configuration information,
if one is a global one, and the other a local one. We use it to merge
the templates from the FAI package, and our local configuration, which
contains encrypted passwords and other information that should not be
readable by others.  If you remove a file in your local configuration,
do not forget to remove this file also in the configuration space,
otherwise it will still be used.

- After calling `set_disk_info`, a list of all local hard disks is
stored in +$disklist+.

- Use `fai-divert -a` if a postinst script calls a configuration
program, e.g. the postinst script for package apache calls
apacheconfig, which needs manual input. You can fake the configuration
program so the installation can be fully automatic. But don't forget
to use `fai-divert -R` to remove all faked scripts.

- During the installation you can execute commands inside the newly
installed system in a chroot environment by using _chroot /target_ or
just _$ROOTCMD_ followed by the command you want to call; for example
_$ROOTCMD dpkg -l_ shows the packages installed on the new system.

////

MT: has been said already The only task which has to be done manually
for new hardware is to assign the MAC address to a host name and to an
IP address, and to define classes for this host if the existing
configuration files are not generic enough to deal with this new host.

There's a trade-off between writing a few large configuration scripts,
or many short scripts, one for each class. Large scripts can
distinguish classes by using case statements, the _ifclass_ test or
with class mechanisms for _cfengine_ scripts.

////

- If your computer can't boot from the network card, you do not always
need to boot from floppy. Add the class _FAI_BOOTPART_ and FAI will
automatically create a lilo or grub entry for booting the FAI
bootfloppy from this partition. So you can start the re-installation
without a boot floppy. This will also make the test phase shorter,
since booting from hard disk is much faster than booting from
floppy. You can also set a password for this boot menu.

- How can I define classes on the kernel command line?
+
Read the man page of `fai-class(8)`

- How to use a custom kernel inside the nfsroot?
+
Build your customized kernel by building a kernel package using
`make-kpkg(8)` and use the option `--initrd`. Copy this Debian package
to a local repository and add it to /etc/fai/sources.list. Add the
name of your package to /etc/fai/NFSROOT. Then rebuild the nfsroot.

- On http://www.layer-acht.org/fai you will find an example how to fully
automatically install a system using the Debian Installer (d-i) in
conjunction with FAI's softupdate (see <<softupdate>>).
