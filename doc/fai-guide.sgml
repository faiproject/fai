your saved time.


<sect id="motivation">Motivation<p> Have you ever performed identical
installations of an operating system several times?  Would you like to
be able to install a Linux cluster with dozens of nodes single
handedly?

<p>
Repeating the same task time and again is boring -- and will surely
lead to mistakes. Also a whole lot of time could be saved if the
installation were done automatically. An installation process with
manual interaction does not scale. But clusters have the habit of
growing over the years. Think long-term rather than plan only just a
few months into the future.

<p>
In 1999, I had to organize an installation of a Linux cluster with one
server and 16 clients. Since I had much experience doing automatic
installation of Solaris operating system on SUN SPARC hardware, the
idea to build an automatic installation for Debian was born. Solaris
has an automatic installation feature called JumpStart<footnote> <p>
Solaris 8 Advanced Installation Guide at
<httpsite>docs.sun.com</httpsite></p> </footnote>. In conjunction
with the auto-install scripts from Casper Dik<footnote><p><url
id="ftp://ftp.wins.uva.nl:/pub/solaris/auto-install/"></p> </footnote>,
I could save a lot of time not only for every new SUN computer, but
also for re-installation of existing workstations. For example, I had
to build a temporary LAN with four SUN workstations for a conference,
which lasted only a few days. I took these workstations out of our normal
research network and set up a new installation for the conference.
When it was over, I simply integrated the workstation back into the
research network, rebooted just once, and after half an hour,
everything was up and running as before. The configuration of all
workstations was exactly the same as before the conference, because
everything was performed by the same installation process. I also use
the automatic installation for reinstalling a workstation after a
damaged hard disk had been replaced. It took two weeks until I
received the new hard disk but only a few minutes after the new disk
was installed, the workstation was running as before. And this is why
I chose to adapt this technique to a PC cluster running Linux.



<sect id="overview">Overview and concepts<p>
<p>
FAI is a non-interactive system to install a &dgl operating system
unattended on
a single computer or a whole cluster. You can take one or more virgin
PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed,
configured and running on the whole cluster, without any interaction
necessary. Thus, it's a scalable method for installing and updating a
cluster unattended with little effort involved. FAI uses the &dgl;
distribution and a collection of shell and perl scripts for the
installation process. Changes to the configuration files of the
operating system can be made by cfengine, shell, perl and expect scripts.

<p>
FAI's target group are system administrators who have to install
Debian onto one or even hundreds of computers. Because it's a general
purpose installation tool, it can be used for installing a Beowulf
cluster, a rendering farm or a Linux laboratory or a classroom. Also
large-scale Linux networks with different hardware or different installation
requirements are easy to establish using FAI. But don't forget to plan
your installation. <ref id="plan"> has some useful hints for this topic.
<p>
First, some terms used in this manual are described.

<taglist>
	  <tag> install server : <item> <p>The host where the package
	  FAI is installed. It provides several services and data for
	  all install clients. In the examples of this manual this
	  host is called <tt>kueppers</tt>.

	  <tag>install client : <item> A host which will be installed using
	  FAI and a configuration from the install server. Also called
	  client for short. In this manual, the example hosts are
	  called <tt>demohost, nucleus, atom01, atom02,...</tt></p> </item>
	  <tag> configuration : <item> The details of how the installation
	  of the clients should be performed. This includes information about:
<list>
		<item> <p>Hard disk layout</p> </item>
		<item> <p>Local filesystems, their types, mount points
		and mount options</p> </item>
		<item> <p>Software packages</p>	</item>
		<item> <p>Keyboard layout, time zone, NIS,
		XFree86 configuration, remote filesystems, user accounts,
		printers ...</p>	</item>
</list>
	  <tag> nfsroot : <item> A (chroot) filesystem located on the install
	  server. It's the complete filesystem for the install
	  clients during the installation process. All clients share the
	  same nfsroot, which they mount read only.</item>
</taglist>

<sect id="work">How does FAI work?<p> 

The install client which will be installed using FAI, is
booted from floppy disk or via network card. It gets an IP address and
boots a linux kernel which mounts its root filesystem via NFS from the install
server. After the operating system is running, the FAI startup script
performs the automatic installation which doesn't need any
interaction. First, the hard disks will be partitioned, filesystems are
created and then software packages are installed. After that, the new
installed operating system is configured to your local needs using
some scripts. Finally the new operating system will be booted from the local
disk.
<p>
The details, of how to install the computer (the configuration), are
stored in the configuration space on the install server. Configuration
files are shared among groups of computers if they are similar using the
class concept. So you need not to create a configuration for every new
host. Hence, FAI is a scalable method to install a big cluster with a
great number of nodes.

<p>
FAI can also be used as an network rescue system. You can boot your
computer, but it will not perform an installation. Instead it will run a
fully functional &dgl without using the local hard disks. Then you can
do a remote login and backup or restore a disk partition, check a filesystem,
inspect the hardware or do any other task.

<chapt id="inst">Installing FAI
<sect id="requirements">Requirements<p> 

The following items are required for an installation via FAI.

<taglist>
	  <tag>A computer: </tag><item> The computer must have a
	  network interface card. Unless a diskless installation
	  should be performed a local hard disk is also needed. No floppy disk,
	  CD-ROM, keyboard or graphic card is needed.</item>

	  <tag>DHCP or BOOTP server: </tag><item> <p> 
The clients need one of these daemons to obtain boot information. But
	  you can also put all this information onto the boot floppy.</item>

	  <tag>TFTP server:<item> The TFTP daemon is used for
	  transferring the kernel to the clients. It's only needed when
	  booting from network card with a boot PROM.</item>
	  <tag>Client root:<item> It is a mountable directory which contains the whole
	  filesystem for the install clients during installation. It will
	  be created during the setup of the FAI package and is also
	  called <strong>nfsroot</strong>.</item>
	  <tag>Debian mirror:<item> Access to a Debian
	  mirror is needed. A local mirror of all Debian packages or
	  an <manref name="apt-proxy" section="8"> is recommended if
	  you install several computers.</item>
	  <tag>Install kernel: <item> A kernel image that supports the
	  network card and mounts its root filesystem via NFS. The
	  Debian package <package>fai-kernels</package> provides a
	  default kernel for fai.</item>
	  <tag>Configuration space:<item> This directory tree which
	  contains the configuration data is a mounted via NFS by
	  default. But you can also get this directory from a revision
	  control system like CVS.
	</taglist>
<p>
The TFTP daemon and a NFS server will be enabled automatically when
installing the FAI package. All clients must have a network card
which is recognized by the install kernel.
<p>


<sect id="debian-mirror">How to create a local Debian mirror<p> 

The script <prgn>mkdebmirror</prgn> <footnote> You can find the script in
 <p><file>/usr/share/doc/fai/examples/utils/</file>.</p> </footnote> can be used
 for creating your own local Debian mirror. This script uses the
 script <manref name="debmirror" section="1"> and <manref name="rsync"
 section="1">. A partial Debian mirror only for i386 architecture for
 Debian 3.1 (aka sarge) without the source packages needs about
 &mirrorsize of disk space. Accessing the mirror via NFS will be the
 normal and fastest way in most cases. To see more output from the
 script call <tt>mkdebmirror --debug</tt>. You need not to create and maintain
 the Debian mirror with the root account.
<p>
You can use the command <manref name="fai-mirror" section="1"> for
creating a partitial mirror, that only contains the software
packages that are used in the classes in your configuration space.

To use HTTP access to the local Debian mirror, install the web server
software and create a symlink to the local directory where you mirror
is located:

<example># apt-get install apache2
# ln -s /files/scratch/debmirror /var/www/debmirror
</example>

Create a file <manref name="sources.list" section="5"> in
<file>/etc/fai</file> which gives access to your Debian mirror. An
example can be found in
<file>/usr/share/doc/fai/examples/etc</file>. Also add the IP-address
of the http server to the variable <var>NFSROOT_ETC_HOSTS</var> in
&mfnc; when the install clients have no DNS access.

<sect id=faisetup> Setting up FAI<p>

Before installing FAI, you have to install the package <package>fai-kernels</package>,
which contains the install kernels for FAI. You can install both
packages using

&packageinstall

If you like to install all recommended packages that are useful for
fai, use following command

<p><example>
# aptitude -r install fai fai-kernels
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree       
Reading extended state information      
Initializing package states... Done
Reading task descriptions... Done  
The following NEW packages will be automatically installed:
  binutils debootstrap dhcp3-server mtools nfs-kernel-server rsh-server 
  syslinux tftpd-hpa 
Do you want to continue? [Y/n/?] 
</example><p>

The suggested packages for FAI are: <tt>ssh, debmirror, mknbi, apt-move, mkinitrd-cd, grub</tt>.<p>

You can also get the newest version of <package>fai</package> and
<package>fai-kernels</package> from the download page of fai and
install the packages using the
<prgn>dpkg</prgn> command.
<p>The configuration for the FAI package (not the configuration data
for the install clients) are defined in &fc;. Definition that are only
used for creating the nfsroot are located in &mfnc;. Edit these files before calling
<prgn>fai-setup</prgn>. These are important variables in &mfnc;:

<taglist>
	    <tag><var>FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP</var></tag>
	    <item>
	  <p>For building the nfsroot there's the command called
	  <manref name="debootstrap" section="8">. It needs
	  the location of a Debian mirror and the name of the distribution
	  (woody,sarge,sid) for which the basic Debian
	  system should be built.
	    </p> </item>

	    <tag><var>NFSROOT_ETC_HOSTS</var></tag>
	    <item>
	      <p>If you use http or ftp access to the Debain mirror,
	      add its IP-address and the name to this
	      variabel. For a Beowulf master node, add the name and
	      IP-address of both networks to it. This variable is not
	      needed when the clients have access to a DNS server.</p>
	    </item>

	    <tag><var>FAI_SOURCES_LIST</var></tag> <item> <p>Now
	    deprecated. Use the file
	    <file>/etc/fai/sources.list</file> instead.<p>
	    </p> </item>

	    <tag><var>KERNELPACKAGE</var></tag>
	    <item>
	  <p> You must specify the software package - build with <manref
	      name="make-kpkg" section="8"> - which includes
	      the default kernel for booting the install clients. The
	      Debian package <package>fai-kernels</package> contains the
	      default install kernels which supports both the 
	      DHCP and BOOTP protocol.</p></item>
	<tag> <var>NFSROOT_PACKAGES</var></tag>
	    <item>
	  <p> This variable contains a list of additional software packages which
	  will be added to the nfsroot.</p></item>

	    <tag><var>FAI_BOOT</var></tag>
	    <item><p>
	    which of DHCP and/or BOOTP should the server create setups for
	    (when make-fai-nfsroot is run). The default is to create
	    the setup for both protocols.
	    </p></item>
	  </taglist>
<p>

These are important variables in &fc;:
<taglist>
	    <tag><var>FAI_LOCATION</var></tag>
	    <item><p>This is the host name and the remote directory of
	  the configuration space, which will be mounted via NFS. It's
	  default value is <file>/usr/local/share/fai</file> but some
	  like to use <file>/home/fai/config</file> or
	  <file>/var/fai/config</file>. Remember that this directory
	  must be exported to all install clients, so that all files
	  can be read by root. </p></item>

	    <tag><var>FAI_DEBMIRROR</var></tag>
	    <item>
	      <p> If you have NFS access to your local Debian mirror,
	      specify the remote filesystem. It will be mounted to
	      <var>$MNTPOINT</var>, which must also be defined. It's
	      not needed if you use access via FTP or HTTP.</p>
	      </item>
	  </taglist><p>


The content of <file>/etc/fai/sources.list</file> and <var>FAI_DEBMIRROR</var>
are used by the install server and also by the clients. If your
install server has multiple network card and different host names for
each card (as for a Beowulf server), use the install
server name which is known by the install clients.<p>

FAI uses <manref name="apt-get" section="8"> to create the nfsroot
filesystem in <file>/usr/lib/fai/nfsroot</file>. It needs about
&nfsrootsize of free disk space. Before setting up FAI, you should get
the program <prgn>imggen</prgn>,<footnote>Available at the download
page <httpsite>www.ltsp.org</httpsite> or from the FAI download
page &faidownload;.</footnote> if you like to boot from a 3Com network
card. This executable converts netboot images created by <manref
name="mknbi-linux" section="8">, so they can be booted by network
cards from 3Com. Put that executable in your path
(e.g. <file>/usr/local/bin</file>). After editing &fc; and &mfnc call
<prgn>fai-setup</prgn>.

&faisetup

<p>
A complete log of fai-setup is available on the fai web page.
It's important that you will see both lines that are marked with an
asterisk. Otherwise something went wrong. If you'll get a lot of blank
lines, it's likely that you are using <tt>konsole</tt>, the X terminal
emulation for KDE which has a bug. Try again using <tt>xterm</tt>.
<p>
The warning messages from dpkg about dependencies problems can be ignored.
If you have problems running fai-setup, they stem usually from 
<manref name="make-fai-nfsroot" section="8">. You may restart it by
calling 'make-fai-nfsroot -r'
(recover). Adding '-v' gives you a more verbose output which may help you 
pinpoint the error. If you want to create a log file you may use
<p><tt>
sudo /usr/sbin/make-fai-nfsroot -r -v 2>&1 | tee make-fai-nfsroot.log
</tt><p>
It may helpful to enter the chroot environment manually
<example>
sudo chroot /usr/lib/fai/nfsroot
</example>
The setup routine adds some lines to <file>/etc/exports</file> to export
the nfsroot and the configuration space to all hosts that belong to
the netgroup <em>faiclients</em>. If you already export a parent directory
of these directories, you may comment out these lines, since the kernel nfs
server has problems exporting a directory and one of its
subdirectories with different options.

All install clients must belong to this netgroup,
in order to mount these directories successfully. Netgroups are
defined in <file>/etc/netgroup</file> or in the corresponding NIS
map. An example for the netgroup file can be found in
<file>/usr/share/doc/fai/examples/etc/netgroup</file>. For more
information, read the manual pages <manref name="netgroup"
section="5"> and the NIS HOWTO. After changing the netgroups, the NFS
server has to reload its configuration. Use one of the following
commands, depending on which NFS server you are using:

<example>
kueppers# /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server reload
kueppers# /etc/init.d/nfs-user-server reload
</example>

<p>
The setup also creates the account <tt>fai</tt> (defined by $LOGUSER)
if not already available. So you can add a user before calling <manref
name="fai-setup" section="8"> using the command
<manref name="adduser" section="8"> and use this as your local account
for saving log files. The log
files of all install clients are saved to the home directory of this
account. If you boot from network card, you should change the primary
group of this account, so this account has write permissions to
<file>/boot/fai</file> in order to change the symbolic links to the kernel
image which is booted by a client.


<p>
After that, FAI is installed successfully on your server, but has no
configuration for the install clients. Start with the examples from
<tt> /usr/share/doc/fai/examples/simple/</tt> using the copy command above
and read <ref id="config">. Before you can set up a DHCP or BOOTP
daemon, you should collect some network information of all your
install clients. This is described in section <ref id="bootfloppy">.
<p>
When you make changes to &fc;, &mfnc; the nfsroot has to be rebuilt by calling <manref
name="make-fai-nfsroot" section="8">. If you only like to install a new kernel to
the nfsroot add the flags <tt>-k</tt> or <tt>-K</tt> to
<tt>make-fai-nfsroot</tt>. This will not recreate your nfsroot, but
only updates your kernel and kernel modules inside the nfsroot

<sect1 id=troublefaisetup> Troubleshooting the setup<p>

The setup of FAI adds the FAI account, exports file systems and calls
<manref name="make-fai-nfsroot" section="8">. If you call
<tt>make-fai-nfsroot -v</tt> you
will see more messages. When using a local Debian mirror, it's
important that the install server can mount this directory via
NFS. If this mount fails, check <file>/etc/exports</file> and <file>/etc/netgroup</file>.
An example can be found in <file>/usr/share/doc/fai/examples/etc/netgroup</file>.


<chapt id="booting">Preparing booting <p> 

Before booting for the first time, you have to choose which medium you
use for booting. You can use the boot floppy or configure the computer
to boot via network card using a boot PROM, which is much smarter. 

<sect id="nicboot">Booting from 3Com network card with boot PROM
<p>
If you have a 3Com network card that is equipped with a boot ROM by
Lanworks Technologies or already includes the DynamicAccess Managed PC
Boot Agent (MBA) software<footnote> <p><httpsite>support.3com.com/</httpsite>
<httppath>infodeli/tools/nic/mba.htm</httppath></p></footnote>, you
can enter the MBA setup by typing <tt>Ctrl+Alt+B</tt> during boot. The
setup should look like this:

<example>
Managed PC Boot Agent (MBA) v4.00

===============================================================================
                            Configuration

Boot Method:                PXE

Default Boot:               Network
Local Boot:                 Enabled
Config Message:             Enabled
Message Timeout:            3 Seconds
Boot Failure Prompt:        Wait for timeout
===============================================================================
  Use cursor keys to edit: Up/Down change field, Left/Right change value
  ESC to quit, F9 restore previous settings, F10 to save
</example>

Set the boot method to <tt>PXE</tt> and enable local boot in this
menu. So the first boot device will be the network card using PXE, and
the second should be the local hard disk. This has to be configured in
the BIOS of your computer. If you like to use the BOOTP protocol
choose <tt>TCP/IP</tt> and set the protocol to <tt>BOOTP</tt>. 

When using BOOTP, you have to make a
symbolic link from the hostname of your client to the appropriate
kernel image in <file>/boot/fai</file>. You can also use the utility
<prgn>tlink</prgn> (<file>/usr/share/doc/fai/examples/utils/tlink</file>) to create
this link. The file
<file>installimage_3com</file> is created by <prgn>imggen</prgn> and
is suitable for booting 3Com network cards<footnote> <p>If you have
problems booting with a 3Com network card and get the error "BOOTP
record too large" after the kernel is transfered to the computer, try
the imggen-1.00 program to convert the netboot image to a
installimage_3com image. I had this problem using netboot 0.8.1-4 and
Image Creator for MBA ROMs v1.01, Date: Nov 26, 2001 but only on an
Athlon computer.
</p></footnote>.

<sect id="pxeboot">Booting from network card with a PXE conforming boot ROM<p>
Most modern bootable network cards support the PXE boot environment.
Some network cards (e.g. Intel EtherExpress PRO 100) have a fixed
boot configuration, so they can only use the PXE boot protocol. This requires a PXE
Linux boot loader and a special version of the <tt>TFTP</tt> daemon,
which is available in the Debian package <package>tftpd-hpa</package>.

First install following additional needed packages:

<example>
# apt-get install dhcp3-server syslinux tftpd-hpa
</example>

Then set up the DHCP daemon. A sample configuration files can be
found in <file>/usr/share/doc/fai/examples/etc/dhcpd.conf</file>. Copy
this file to <file>/etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf</file>.
Then enable the special tftp daemon
using this line in file <file>/etc/inetd.conf</file>: 
<example>
tftp dgram udp wait root /usr/sbin/in.tftpd in.tftpd -s /boot/fai
</example>

The install client then loads the pxelinux boot loader which receives
its configuration via TFTP from a file in the directory
<file>/boot/fai/pxelinux.cfg</file>. Using the command <manref
name="fai-chboot" section="8"> you can 
define which kernel and will be loaded by the PXE linux loader and
which additional parameters are passed to this kernel. You should
read the manual pages, which gives you some good examples.

See <file>/usr/share/doc/syslinux/pxelinux.doc</file> for more
information about how to boot such an environment. The PXE
environment uses the original kernel image (not the netboot image made
by mknbi-linux) which is copied to
<file>/boot/fai/vmlinuz-install</file>.


<sect id="bootfloppy">Creating a boot floppy
<p>

If your network card can't boot itself, you have two options. The
first is to create a small boot floppy that uses etherboot, so you can
use DHCP and TFTP to get the install kernel that was created with
<manref name="mknbi-linux" section="8">.  A lot of ethernet cards
support booting via ethernet if a special boot eprom is inserted or
booted from floppy <httpsite>rom-o-matic.net/</httpsite>. In
depth documentation about booting via ethernet may be found at
<httpsite>etherboot.sourceforge.net</httpsite>.

The second option is to boot via floppy disk that is created with the
command <manref name="make-fai-bootfloppy" section="8">. Since there's
no client specific 
information on this floppy, it's suitable for all your install
clients. You can also specify additional kernel parameters for this
boot floppy or set other variables, if desired. Do not enable BOOTP
support when you have a DHCP server running in your network and vice
versa. This could lead to missing information. There's also a manual
page for <manref name="make-fai-bootfloppy" section="8">. If you have
no BOOTP or DHCP server, supply the network configuration as kernel
parameters. The format is
<p>
<tt>ip=&lt;client-ip&gt;:&lt;server-ip&gt;:&lt;gw-ip&gt;:&lt;netmask&gt;:&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;device&gt;:&lt;autoconf&gt;
</tt>
for setting up the network and
<tt>nfsroot=[&lt;server-ip&gt;:]&lt;root-dir&gt;[,&lt;nfs-options&gt;]</tt>
for specifying the nfsroot (which is required as the default path is not
suitable for FAI.)
<p>
For additional information see
<file>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/nfsroot.txt</file> in the kernel
sources.

<sect id="cdboot">Booting from a CD-ROM<p>

It's possible to perform an automatic installation from CD-ROM without
an install server. The CD-ROM contains all data needed for the
installation. The command <manref name="fai-cd" section="8"> puts the
nfsroot, the configuration space and a subset of the Debian mirror
onto a CD-ROM. The partitial mirror is created using the command
<manref name="fai-mirror" section="1"> which contains all packages
that are used by the classes used in your configuration space.

A sample ISO image is available at
<httpsite>www.informatik.uni-koeln.de</httpsite><httppath>/fai/fai-cd/</httppath>.

<sect id="mac">Collecting Ethernet addresses<p>

Now it's time to boot your install clients for the first time. They
will fail to boot completely, because no BOOTP or DHCP daemon is running yet or
recognizes the hosts. But you can use this first boot attempt to
easily collect all Ethernet addresses of the network cards.
<p>

You have to collect all Ethernet (MAC) addresses of the install clients
and assign a hostname and IP address to each client. To collect 
 all MAC addresses, now boot all your install clients. While the
install clients are booting, they send broadcast packets to the LAN. You
can log the MAC addresses of these hosts by running the following
command simultaneously on the server:

<example># tcpdump -qte broadcast and port bootpc >/tmp/mac.lis</example>

<p>
After the hosts has been sent some broadcast packets (they will fail
to boot because <prgn>bootpd</prgn> isn't running or does not recognize the MAC
address yet) abort <prgn>tcpdump</prgn> by typing <tt>ctrl-c</tt>. You get a list
of all unique MAC addresses with these commands:

<example># perl -ane 'print "\U$F[0]\n"' /tmp/mac.lis|sort|uniq</example>

After that, you only have to assign these MAC addresses to hostnames
and IP addresses (<file>/etc/ethers</file> and <file>/etc/hosts</file>
or corresponding NIS maps). With this information you can configure
your <prgn>BOOTP</prgn> or <prgn>DHCP</prgn> daemon (see the section
<ref id="bootptab">). I recommend to write the MAC addresses (last
three bytes will suffice if you have network cards from the same
vendor) and the hostname in the front of each chassis.

<sect id=bootptab>Configuration of the BOOTP daemon<p>

You should only use this method if you can't use a DHCP server, since
it's easier to create and manage the configuration for DHCP.
An example configuration for the BOOTP daemon can be found in
<file>/usr/share/doc/fai/examples/etc/bootptab</file>.

<example>
# /etc/bootptab example for FAI

# now one entry for each install client
demohost:ha=0x00105A240012:bf=demohost:tc=.failocal:T172="verbose sshd createvt debug":
ant01:ha=0x00105A000000:bf=ant01:tc=.failocal:T172="sshd":
</example>

Insert one line for each install client at the end of this file as
done for the hosts <em>demohost</em> and <em>ant01</em>. Replace the string
<tt>FAISERVER</tt> with the name of your install server. If the
install server has multiple network cards and host names, use the host
name of the network card to which the install clients are
connected. Then adjust the other network tags (<tt>sm, gw, dn,
ds</tt>) to your local needs.

<taglist>
 <tag>sm:</tag> <item>  <p>Subnet mask</p> </item>
 <tag>gw:</tag> <item>  <p>Default gateway / router</p> </item>
 <tag>dn:</tag> <item>  <p>Domain name</p> </item>
 <tag>ds:</tag> <item>  <p>List of DNS server. The
 <file>/etc/resolv.conf</file> file will be created using this list
 of DNS servers and the domain name.
 <tag>T172:</tag> <item>  <p>List of <var>FAI_FLAGS</var>;
 e.g. verbose, debug, reboot, createvt, sshd, syslogd</p> </item>
 </taglist>

The tag for time servers (<tt>nt</tt>) are
optional. Tags with prefix <tt>T</tt> (starting from T170) are generic
tags which are used to transfer some FAI specific data to the
clients<footnote>T170=FAI_LOCATION (now defined in
<file>fai.conf</file> and T171=FAI_ACTION. You can define theses
variables in a class/*.var script. But for backward compatibility, you
can define theses variables also from a BOOTP or DHCP
server.</footnote>

The list of <var>FAI_FLAGS</var> can be space or comma
separated. <var>FAI_FLAGS</var> in <file>bootptab</file> must be
separated by whitespace. If you define <var>FAI_FLAGS</var> as
an additional kernel parameter, the flags must be separated with a
comma.
If you do not have full control over the BOOTP or DHCP daemon (because
this service is managed by a central service group) you can also
define the variable <var>FAI_ACTION</var> in
a <file>/fai/class/*.var</file> scripts.

When you have created your <file>bootptab</file> file, you have to
enable the BOOTP daemon once. It's installed but Debian does not enable it
by default. Edit <file>/etc/inetd.conf</file> and remove the comment
(the hash) in the line containing <tt>#bootps</tt>. Then tell
<prgn>inetd</prgn> to reload its configuration.

<example># /etc/init.d/inetd reload</example>

The BOOTP daemon automatically reloads the configuration file if any changes are
made to it. The daemon for DHCP must always be manually restarted
after changes to the configuration file are made.

<p>
Now it's time to boot all install clients again!
FAI can perform several actions when the client is booting. This action
is defined in the variable <var>FAI_ACTION</var>.
Be very careful if you set <var>FAI_ACTION </var> to
<em>install</em>. This can destroy all your data on the install
client, indeed most time it should do this ;-). It's recommended to change this only
on a per-client base in the BOOTP configuration. Do not change it in
the section <tt>.failocal</tt> in <file>/etc/bootptab</file>, which
is a definition for all clients.

<sect1 id=troublebootp>Troubleshooting BOOTP daemon<p>
The BOOTP daemon can also be started in debug mode if it is not
enabled in <file>inetd.conf</file>:
<example># bootpd -d7</example>

<sect id="bootdhcp">Configuration of the DHCP daemon <p>
An example for <manref name="dhcp.conf" section="5"> is available in
<file>/usr/share/doc/fai/examples/etc</file>, which is working with
version 3.x of the DHCP daemon. Start using this example
and look at all options used therein. 

One issue to bear in mind when configuring your DHCP daemon is that the
daemon needs to supply the nfsroot path to the client because
the kernel uses a path different from 
<file>/usr/lib/fai/nfsroot</file> by default.

If you make any changes
to the DHCP daemon configuration, you must restart the daemon.
<example># /etc/init.d/dhcp3-server restart</example>
Therefore it's recommended to only supply data into this configuration
file, which doesn't change frequently. By default, the DHCP daemon
write its log files to <file>/var/log/daemon.log</file>.
The command <manref name="fai-chboot" section="8"> is used for creating a per host
configuration for the pxelinux environment.


<sect id="bootmesg">Boot messages <p>

These are the messages when booting from floppy disk.
<example>
GRUB loading stage2..............
&lt now the grub menu with multiple boot options is displayed &gt;
BOOTING 'FAI-BOTH'
kernel (fd0)/vmlinuz-2.4.27 root=/dev/nfs ip=both
  [Linux-bzImage, setup=0x1400, size=0xd8450]

Uncompressing Linux... OK, booting the Kernel.
Linux version &kver; (root@kueppers) (gcc version 2.95.4 20011002
.
.
.
</example>
After this, the rest of the boot message will be equal to those when booting from
network card. When booting from network card with PXE you will see:

&bootexample

When the copyright message of fai is shown, the install client has mounted
the nfsroot<footnote> <p><file>/usr/lib/fai/nfsroot</file> from the
install server</p> </footnote> to the clients' root directory
<file>/</file>. This is the whole filesystem for the client at this
moment. 

After <tt>task_confdir</tt> is executed, the configuration space is
mounted or received from an CVS repository.

Before the installation is started (FAI_ACTION=install) the computer
beeps three times. So, be watchful when you hear three beeps
but you do not want to perform an installation!

<sect1 id=booterror>Troubleshooting the boot messages<p>

This is the error message you will see, when your network card is
working, but the install server does not export the configuration
space directory to the install clients, mostly a problem of missing
permissions on the isntall server side.
<example>
Root-NFS: Server returned error -13 while mounting /usr/lib/fai/nfsroot
VFS: Unable to mount root fs via NFS, trying floppy.
VFS: Cannot open root device "nfs" or 02:00
Kernel panic: VFS Unable to mount root fs on 02:00
</example>
Use the following command to see which directories are exported
from the install server (named kueppers):
<example>showmount -e kueppers</example>

<p>

The following error message indicates that your install client doesn't
get an answer from a DHCP server. Check your cables or start the
<manref name="dhcpd" section="8"> daemon with the debug flag enabled.
<example>
PXE-E51: No DHCP or BOOTP offers received
Network boot aborted
</example>

These are the messages when you are using the BOOTP method and no
BOOTP server replies.
<example>
Sending BOOTP requests ........ timed out!
IP-Config: Retrying forever (NFS root)...
</example>

If you get the following error message, the install kernel has
no driver compiled in for your network card. 
<example>
IP-Config: No network devices available
Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 < hda5 hda6 hda7 hda8 >
Root-NFS: No NFS server available, giving up.
VFS: Unable to mount root fs via NFS, trying floppy.
VFS: Insert root floppy and press ENTER
</example>
Then you have to compile the driver for your network card into a new
kernel. This driver must not be a kernel module. The README file of
the package fai-kernels <file>/usr/share/doc/fai-kernels/README</file>
describes how to  compile custom fai kernel. After that, adjust the
variable <var>KERNELPACKAGE</var> in  &mfnc; and rebuild the nfsroot
with the command <manref name="make-fai-nfsroot" section="8">.
After that, you have to create a new boot floppy if you need it. Now your network
card should be recognized and the install kernel should mount
the nfsroot successfully.

<sect id="sysinfo">Collecting other system information 
<p>

Now the clients have booted with <var>FAI_ACTION</var> set to <em>sysinfo</em>. Type
<tt>ctrl-c</tt> to get a shell or use <tt>Alt-F2</tt> or
<tt>Alt-F3</tt> and you will get another console terminal, if you have added <tt>createvt</tt>
to <var>FAI_FLAGS</var>.

Remote login is available via the secure shell if <tt>sshd</tt> is
added to <var>FAI_FLAGS</var>. The encrypted password is set with
variable <var>FAI_ROOTPW</var> in &mfnc; and defaults to "fai". You can
create the encrypted password using <manref name="mkpasswd" section="1">. This
is only the root password during the installation process, not for the
new installed system. You can also log in without a password when
using <var> SSH_IDENTITY</var>. To log in from your server to the
install client (named demohost in this example) use:

<example>> ssh root@demohost
Warning: Permanently added 'demohost,134.95.9.200' to the list of known hosts.
root@demohost's password: 
</example>


You now have a running Linux system on the install client
without using the local hard disk. Use this as a rescue system if
your local disk is damaged or the computer can't boot properly from
hard disk. You will get a shell and you can execute various commands
(dmesg, lsmod, df, lspci, ...). Look at the log file in
<file>/tmp/fai</file>. There you can find much information about the boot
process.

All log files from <file>/tmp/fai</file> are also written to the
<var>$LOGSERVER</var> (if not defined: the install server) into the
directory <tt>~fai/demohost/sysinfo/</tt><footnote>More general:
<tt>~$LOGUSER/$HOSTNAME/$FAI_ACTION/</tt>. Two additional symbolic
links are created. The symlink <file>last</file> points to the log
directory of the last fai action performed. The symlinks
<file>last-install</file> and <file>last-sysinfo</file> point to the
directory with of the last corresponding action.

Examples of the log
files can be found on the FAI homepage.
</footnote>

<p>
A very nice feature is that FAI mounts all filesystems it finds on
the local disks read only. It also tells you on which partition a file
<file>/etc/fstab</file> exists. When only one file system table is found, the
partitions are mounted according to this information. Here's an
example:
<example>
demohost:~# df

Filesystem 1k-blocks     Used Available Use% Mounted on
rootfs       2064192  1071184    888152  55% /

/dev/hda6     202225     8834   182949    5% /tmp/target/var
</example>

<strong>This method can be used as a rescue environment!</strong> In the
future it will be possible to make backups or restore data to existing
filesystems. If you need a filesystem with read-write access use the
<prgn>rwmount</prgn> command:

<example>demohost:~# rwmount /tmp/target/home</example> 

<sect id=checkbootp>Checking parameters from BOOTP and DHCP servers<p>

If the install client boots with action <em>sysinfo</em>, you can also
check if all information from the BOOTP or DHCP daemons are received
correctly. The received information is written to
<file>/tmp/fai/boot.log</file>. An example of the result of a DHCP
request can be found in <ref id="s1">.


<sect id=reboot>Rebooting the computer<p>
At any time you can reboot the computer using the command
<prgn>faireboot</prgn>, also if logged in from remote. If the
installation hasn't finished, use <tt>faireboot -s</tt>, so the log
files are also copied to the install server.

<chapt id=instprocess>Overview of the installation sequence<p>

The following tasks are performed during an installation after the linux kernel
has booted on the install clients.

<enumlist>
	    <item> <p>Set up FAI </p> </item>
	    <item> <p>Load kernel modules</p> </item>
	    <item> <p>Define classes</p> </item>
	    <item> <p>Define variables</p> </item>
	    <item> <p>Partition local disks</p> </item>
	    <item> <p>Create and mount local filesystems</p> </item>
	    <item> <p>Install software packages</p> </item>
	    <item> <p>Call site specific configuration scripts</p> </item>
	    <item> <p>Save log files</p> </item>
	    <item> <p>Reboot the new installed system</p> </item>
	  </enumlist>

You can also define additional programs or scripts
which will be run on particular
occasions. They are called <tt>hooks</tt>. Hooks can add additional
functions to the installation process or replace the default subtasks
of FAI. So it's very easy to
customize the whole installation process. Hooks are explained in
detail in <ref id="hooks">.

<p>
The installation time is determined by the amount of software but also
by the speed of the processor and hard disk. Here are some sample
times. All install clients have an 100Mbit network card installed.
Using a 10 Mbit LAN does not increase the installation time
considerably, so the network will not be the bottleneck when
installing several clients simultaneously.

<example>
Athlon XP1600+    , 896MB,SCSI disk,   1 GB software  6 min
AMD-K7, 500MHz    , 320MB, IDE disk, 780 MB software 12 min
PentiumPro 200MHz , 128MB, IDE disk, 800 MB software 28 min
Pentium III 850MHz, 256MB, IDE disk, 820 MB software 10 min
Pentium III 850MHz, 256MB, IDE disk, 180 MB software  3 min
</example>


<sect id=faimond>Monitoring the installation<p>
You can monitor the installation of all install clients with the
command <manref name="faimond" section="8">. All clients check if this
daemon is running on the install server (or the machine defined by the variable
<var>monserver</var>. Then, a message is sent when a task starts and
ends. The fai monitor daemon prints this messages to standard
output. In the future, there will be a graphical frontend available.


<sect id=isetup>Set up FAI<p>

After the install client has booted, only the script
<file>/usr/sbin/fai</file><footnote><p>Since the root filesystem on
the clients is mounted via NFS, <prgn>fai</prgn> is located in
<file>/usr/lib/fai/nfsroot/usr/sbin</file> on the install server.</p>
</footnote> is executed. This is the main script which controls the
sequence of tasks for FAI. No other scripts in
<file>/etc/init.d/</file> are executed.
<p>
A ramdisk is created and mounted to <file>/tmp</file>, which is the
only writable directory until local filesystems are
mounted. Additional parameters are received from the BOOTP or DHCP
daemon and the configuration space if
mounted via NFS from the install server to <file>/fai</file>. The
setup is finished after additional virtual terminals are created and
the secure shell daemon for remote access is started on demand.

<sect id=iclass>Defining classes, variables and loading kernel modules<p>

Now the script <manref name="fai-class" section="1"> is used to define
classes. Therefore several scripts in <file>/fai/class/</file> are
executed to define classes. All scripts matching <tt>[0-9]*</tt>
(they start with a digit)
are executed in alphabetical order. Every word that these scripts
print to the standard output are interpreted as class names. 
Scripts ending in <tt>.source</tt>
are sourced, so they can define new classes by adding these classes to
the variable <var>newclasses</var> (see <file>06hwdetect.source</file> for an
example). The output of these scripts is ignored.
These classes are defined for the
install client. You can also say this client belongs to these
classes. A class is defined or undefined and has no value. Only
defined classes are of interest for an install client. The description
of all classes can be found in
<file>/usr/share/doc/fai/classes_description.txt</file>. It is
advisable to document the job a new class performs. Then, this
documentation is the base for composing the whole configuration from classes.
The scripts <prgn>06hwdetectsource</prgn> loads kernel modules on
demand.
The complete description of all these scripts can be found in <ref id="cscripts">.

<p>
The script <file>30menu.source</file> pops up a little menu and asks
the user which kind of installation should be performed (e.g. CAD
workstation, notebook, scientific workstation, work group server, Gnome
desktop...). Keep in mind that this won't lead to a fully automatic
installation ;-)
<p>
After defining the classes, every file matching <tt>*.var</tt> with a
prefix which matches a defined class is executed to define variables.
There, you should define the variable <var>FAI_ACTION</var> and
others. By default, <var>FAI_ACTION</var> is defined via the command
<manref name="fai-chboot" section="8">.


<sect id=ipartition>Partitioning local disks, creating filesystems<p>

For disk partitioning exactly one disk configuration file from
<file>/fai/disk_config</file> is selected using classes. It's the
description of how all the local disks will be partitioned, where
filesystems should be created (and their types like ext2, ext3,
reiserfs), and how they are mounted. It's also possible to preserve
the disk layout or to preserve the data on certain partitions. It's
done by the command <prgn>setup_harddisks</prgn>, which uses
<prgn>sfdisk</prgn> for partitioning. The format of the configuration
file is described in
<file>/usr/share/doc/fai/README.disk_config</file>.
<p>
During the installation process all local filesystems are mounted
relative to <file>/tmp/target</file>. For example
<file>/tmp/target/home</file> will become <file>/home</file> in the
new installed system.

<sect id=ipackages>Installing software packages<p>

When local filesystems are created, they are all empty (except for
preserved partitions). Now the Debian base system and all requested
software packages are installed on the new filesystems. First the
base archive is unpacked, then the command
<manref name="install_packages" section="8"> installs all packages using <manref
name="apt-get" section="8"> or <manref name="aptitude" section="1">
without any manual interaction needed. If a packages requires an other
package, both commands resolve this dependency by installing the
required package.
<p>

Classes are also used when selecting the configuration files in
<file>/fai/package_config/</file> for software installation. The
format of the configuration files is described in <ref
id="packageconfig">.

<sect id=icscripts>Site specific configuration<p>

After all requested software packages are installed, the system is
nearly ready to go. But not all default configurations of the software
packages will meet your site specific needs. So you can call arbitrary
scripts which adjust the system configuration. Therefore scripts which
match a class name in <file>/fai/scripts</file> will be executed. If
<file>/fai/scripts/</file><var>classname/</var> is a directory, all
scripts that match <tt>[0-9][0-9]*</tt> in this directory are executed. So
it is possible to have several scripts of different types (shell,
cfengine, ...) to be executed for one class. FAI comes with some
examples for these scripts, but you can write your own Bourne, bash,
perl, cfengine or expect scripts.
<p>
These important scripts are described in detail in <ref
id="cscripts">.

<sect id=isavelog>Save log files<p> When all installation tasks are
finished, the log files are written to
<tt>/var/log/fai/$HOSTNAME/install/</tt> <footnote>
<p><file>/var/log/fai/localhost/install/</file> is a link to this
directory.</p> </footnote> on the new system and to the account on the
install server if <var>$LOGUSER</var> is defined in &fc;. It is also
possible to specify another host as destination of the log saving by
in a file in <file>/fai/class/</file>. Additionally, two symlinks will
be created to indicated the last directory written.
This method uses rsh/rcp or ssh/scp and is default.

<p>
You can use other methods to save logs to the remote server. The currently
selected method is defined by the <var>$FAI_LOGPROTO</var> variable in 
file &fc;:
<taglist>
 <tag>ftp</tag><item><p>

  This option saves logs to the remote FTP server defined by the
  <var>$LOGSERVER</var> variable (<var>$SERVER</var> value is used if
  not set). Connection to the FTP server is done as user

  the <var>$LOGREMOTEDIR</var> on the FTP server.</p>

  <p> All files in the directory <tt>/tmp/fai</tt> are copied to the

<sect id=ireboot>Reboot the new installed system<p>

At least the system is automatically rebooted if "reboot" was added to
<var>FAI_FLAGS</var>. Normally this should boot the new installed
system from its second boot device, the local hard disk. To skip
booting from network card, you can use the command <manref
name="fai-chboot" section="8"> to enable localboot. If using a boot
floppy you have to remove the floppy from the floppy drive. Otherwise
the installation would be performed again. Read <ref id="changeboot">
for how to change the boot device.

<sect id=impatient>For the impatient user<p>

So, you do not like to read the whole manual? You like to try an
installation without reading the manual? OK. Here's how to succeed in
a few minutes.

<list>
   <item><p>install fai and all recommended packages (see
<ref id="faisetup"> on your install server)</p></item>

<item><p>
Install the simple examples into the configuration space:
<p><tt>cp -a /usr/share/doc/fai/examples/simple/* /usr/local/share/fai/</tt>
</p></item>

<item><p>get the MAC address of your demo host</p></item>
  <item><p>add your host (try to name it <tt>demohost</tt>)
  to <file>/etc/hosts</file> and <file>dhcpd.conf</file></p></item>
<item><p>When using PXE, tell the install client to boot the install
  kernel and perform an installation during the next boot <example>fai-chboot -IFv demohost</example>
</p></item>
<item><p>Boot your demo host and enjoy the fully automatic installation</p></item>
<item><p>If the installation has finished successfully, the computer should boot a
small Debian system. You can login as user <tt>demo</tt> with password <tt>fai</tt>.</p></item>

But now don't forget to read the next chapter <ref id="plan">!

<chapt id=plan>Plan your installation, and FAI installs your plans<p>
<p>
Before starting your installation, you should spend much time in
planning your installation. When you're happy with your installation
concept, FAI can do all the boring, repetitive tasks to turn your plans
into practice. FAI can't do good installations if your concept is
imperfect or lacks some important details. Start planning the
installation by answering the following
questions:

<taglist>
  <tag></tag> <item> <p>Will I create a Beowulf cluster, or do I
  have to install some desktop machines?</p> </item>
  <tag></tag> <item> <p>How does my LAN topology looks like?</p> </item>
  <tag></tag> <item> <p>Do I have uniform hardware?
  Will the hardware stay uniform in the future?</p> </item>
  <tag></tag> <item> <p>Does the hardware need a special kernel?</p> </item>
  <tag></tag> <item> <p>How should the hosts be named?</p> </item>
  <tag></tag> <item> <p>How should the local hard disks be partitioned?</p> </item>
  <tag></tag> <item> <p>Which applications will be run by the users?</p> </item>
  <tag></tag> <item> <p>Do the users need a queueing system?</p> </item>
  <tag></tag> <item> <p>What software should be installed?</p> </item>
  <tag></tag> <item> <p>Which daemons should be started, and what
  should the configuration for these look like?</p> </item>
  <tag></tag> <item> <p>Which remote filesystems should be mounted?</p> </item>
  <tag></tag> <item> <p>How should backups be performed?</p> </item>
  <tag></tag> <item> <p>Do you have sufficient power supply?</p> </item>
  <tag></tag> <item> <p>How much heat do the cluster nodes produce and how are
  they cooled?</p> </item>
</taglist>

You also have to think about user accounts, printers, a mail system, cron jobs,
graphic cards, dual boot, NIS, NTP, timezone, keyboard layout,
exporting and mounting directories via NFS and many other things. So,
there's a lot to do before starting an installation. And remember
that knowledge is power, and it's up to you to use it. Installation
and administration is a process, not a product. FAI can't do things
you don't tell it to do.
<p>
But you need not to start from scratch. Look at all files and scripts
in the configuration space. There are a lot of things you can use for
your own installation.

"Bootstrapping an Infrastructure".

<chapt id=config>Installation details<p>

<sect id=c3>The configuration space<p>

The configuration is the collection of information about how exactly to
install a computer. The central configuration space for all install
clients is located on the install server in <file>/usr/local/share/fai</file>
and its subdirectories. This will be mounted by the install clients to
<file>/fai</file>. It's also possible to receive all the
configuration data from a <manref name="cvs" section="1"> repository.
The following subdirectories are present and include
several files:

<taglist>
	  <tag><tt>class/</tt></tag> <item> <p>Scripts and files to
	   define classes and variables and to load kernel modules.</p> </item>

	  <tag><tt>disk_config/</tt></tag> <item> <p>Configuration
	  files for disk partitioning and file system creation.</p> </item>

	  <tag><tt>debconf/</tt></tag> <item> <p>This directory holds
	  all <manref name="debconf" section="8"> data. The format is
	  the same that is used by <manref name="debconf-set-selections"
	  section="8">.</p> </item>

	  <tag><tt>package_config/</tt></tag> <item> <p>File with
	   lists of software
	  packages to be installed or removed.</p> </item>

	  <tag><tt>scripts/</tt></tag> <item> <p>Script for local site
	   customization.</p> </item>

	  <tag><tt>files/</tt></tag> <item> <p>Files used by
	  customization scripts. 
	   Most files are located in a subtree structure
	   which reflects the ordinary directory tree. For example, the
	   templates for <file>nsswitch.conf</file> are located in
	   <file>/fai/files/etc/nsswitch.conf</file>. Note that the
	  contents of the files directory are not automatically copied
	  to the target machine, rather they must be explicitely
	  copied by customization scripts using the <manref
	  name="fcopy" section="8"> command.</p> </item>

	  <tag><tt>files/packages/</tt></tag> <item> <p>
   The simple example configuration also includes the directory
   <file>/files/packages/</file> which can contain local Debian
   packages. This directory is referenced by default in
   <file>/etc/fai/make-fai-nfsroot.conf</file> as
   <var>FAI_LOCAL_REPOSITORY</var> and will be added to the nfsroot's
   apt sources by <manref name="make-fai-nfsroot" section="8">. Note
   that these packages will not be automatically installed, but will
   be available for installation in your customization scripts using
   <prgn>install_packages</prgn> or apt-get. For example,
   <file>.../DEFAULT/S01</file> uses the variable
   <var>$addpackages</var> and apt-get for installing any packages
   specified in the this variable.

   In order to create a valid Packages.gz, which is needed for using
   this simple repository, first place all desired .deb files in
   <file>files/packages</file> on the install server, then from the
   files directory execute the following command:
<example>
# cd /usr/local/share/fai/files
# dpkg-scanpackages packages /dev/null | \
  gzip -9 > packages/Packages.gz
</example>
</p> </item>

	  <tag><tt>hooks/</tt></tag> <item> <p>Hooks are user defined
	  programs or scripts, which are called during the
	  installation process.</p> </item>
</taglist>

The main installation command <manref name="fai" section="8"> uses all these
subdirectories in the order listed except for hooks. The FAI package
contains examples 
for all these configuration scripts and files in
<file>/usr/share/doc/fai/examples</file>. Copy the configuration examples
to the configuration space and start an installation. These files need
not belong to the root account. You can change their ownership and
then edit the configuration with a normal user account.

<example>
# cp -a /usr/share/doc/fai/examples/simple/* /usr/local/share/fai
# chown -R fai /usr/local/share/fai
</example>

These files contain simple configuration for some example
hosts. Depending on the hostname used, your computer will be
configured as follows:

<taglist>  
   <tag>demohost</tag>  <item> <p>A machine which need only a small
   hard disk. This machine is configured with network (as DHCP
   client), and an account demo is created.<p>

   <tag>gnomehost</tag>  <item> <p>A GNOME desktop is installed, and
   the account demo is created. <p>

   <tag>other hostnames</tag>  <item> Hosts with other hostname will
   only use the main class FAIBASE.<p>

</taglist>
Start looking at these examples and study them. Then change or add
things to these examples. But don't forget to plan your own
installation!

<sect id=tasks>The default tasks<p>

After the kernel has booted, it mounts the root file system via NFS
from the install server and <manref name="init" section="8"> starts the script
<file>/usr/sbin/fai</file>. This script controls the
sequence of the installation. No other scripts in
<file>/etc/init.d/</file> are used.
<p>

The installation script uses many subroutines, which are defined in
<file>/usr/share/fai/subroutines</file>, and an operating system specific
file <footnote><file>/usr/share/fai/subroutines-linux</file> for Linux,
<file>/usr/share/fai/subroutines-sunos</file> for Solaris.</footnote>.
All important tasks of the
installation are called via the subroutine <tt>task</tt>
appended by the name of the task as an option (e.g. <tt>task
instsoft</tt>). The subroutine <tt>task</tt> calls hooks with prefix
<em>name</em> if available and then calls the default task (defined as
<tt>task_<em>name</em></tt> in <file>subroutines</file>). The default
task and its hooks can be skipped on demand by using the subroutine
<tt>skiptask()</tt>.<p>

Now follows the description of all default tasks.
<taglist>

      <tag>confdir</tag> <item><p>The kernel appended parameters define
variables, the syslog and kernel log daemon are started. The list of
network devices is stored in <var>$netdevices</var>. Then additional
parameters are fetched from a DHCP or BOOTP server and also
additional variables
are defined. The DNS resolver configuration file is created. The
configuration space is mounted from the install server to
<file>/fai</file> or it is checked out from the corresponding <manref
name="cvs" section="1"> repository. To use a cvs repository, you have
to set the variables <var>$FAI_CVSROOT, $FAI_CVSTAG,
$FAI_CVSMODULE</var>. For details look a the subroutine
<prgn>get_fai_cvs()</prgn>. After that, the file
<file>/fai/hooks/subroutines</file> is sourced if it exists. Using
this file, you can define your own subroutines or override the
definition of FAI's subroutines.

    <tag>setup</tag> <item><p>This task sets the system time, all
      <var>FAI_FLAGS</var> are defined and two additional virtual
      terminals are opened on demand. A secure shell daemon is started
      on demand for remote logins.

     <tag>defclass</tag> <item><p>Calls <manref name="fai-class"
      section="1"> to define classes using scripts and
      files in <file>/fai/class</file> and classes from
      <file>/tmp/fai/additional-classes</file>.</p> </item>

     <tag>defvar</tag> <item><p>Sources all files
      <file>/fai/class/*.var</file> for every defined class. If a hook
      has written some variable definitions to the file
      <file>/tmp/fai/additional.var</file>, this file is also
      sourced.</p></item>

      <tag>action</tag> <item><p>Depending on the value of
      <var>$FAI_ACTION</var> this subroutine decides which action FAI
      should perform. The default available actions are:
      <tt>sysinfo</tt>, <tt>install</tt> and <tt>softupdate</tt>.
      If <var>$FAI_ACTION</var>
      has another value, a user defined action is called if a file
      <file>/fai/hooks/$FAI_ACTION</file> exists. So you
      can easily define your own actions.<p>


      <tag>sysinfo</tag> <item><p>Called when no installation is
      performed but the action is <tt>sysinfo</tt>. It shows information
      about the detected hardware and mounts the local hard disks read
      only to <file>/tmp/target/<var>partitionname</var></file> or with regard to a
      <file>fstab</file> file found inside a partition. Log files are
      stored to the install server.</p> </item> 

     <tag>install</tag> <item><p>This task controls the installation
     sequence. You will hear three beeps before the installation
     starts. The major work is to call other tasks and to save the
     output to <file>/tmp/fai/rcS.log</file>. If you have any problems
     during installation, look at all files in
     <file>/tmp/fai/</file>. You can find examples of the log files
     for some hosts in the download directory of the FAI homepage.</p>
     </item>

     <tag>softupdate</tag> <item>This task, executed inside a running 
     system via the <manref name="fai" section="8"> command line interface, performs a softupdate.
     See chapter <ref id=softupdate> for defails. </item>

     <tag>partition</tag> <item><p>Calls <prgn>setup_harddisk</prgn>
      to partition the hard disks. The task writes variable
      definitions for the root and boot partition and device (<var>$ROOT_PARTITION,

      <file>/tmp/fai/disk_var.sh</file> and creates a <file>fstab</file> file.</p></item>

      <tag>mountdisks</tag> <item><p>Mounts the created partitions

<sect id=s1>The setup routines of the install clients<p>

After the subroutine <prgn>fai_init</prgn> has done some basic
initialization (create ramdisk, read <file>fai.conf</file> and all
subroutines definitions, set path, print copyright notice), the setup
continues by calling the task <tt>confdir</tt> and the task
<tt>setup</tt>. The command <prgn>get-boot-info</prgn> is called to
get all information from the BOOTP or DHCP server. This command writes
the file <file>/tmp/fai/boot.log</file>, which then is sourced to
define the corresponding global variables. This is an example for this
log file when using a DHCP server.

&bootlog

Additional information are passed via the kernel command line or read
from &fc;. When booting in with PXE, command line parameters are created using <manref
name="fai-chboot" section="8">. The variable <var>$FAI_FLAGS</var>
contains a space separated list of flags. The following flags are
known:
<taglist>
 <tag>verbose</tag> <item> <p>Create verbose output during
 installation. This should always be the first flag, so consecutive
 definitions of flags will be verbosely displayed.</p> </item>

 <tag>debug</tag> <item> <p>Create debug output. No unattended
 installation is performed. During package installation you have to
 answer all questions of the postinstall scripts on the
 client's console. A lot of debug information will be printed
 out. This flag is only useful for FAI developers.</p> </item>

 <tag>sshd</tag> <item> <p>Start the ssh daemon to enable remote
 logins.</p> </item>

 <tag>syslogd</tag> <item> <p>Start the system and kernel log daemon, so
  processes can use it to give out information. This flag should only be 
  used when the syslogd is not already running on the system, so it should
  only be set when initially installing, <em>not</em> on updates!
</p> </item> 

  <tag>createvt</tag> <item> <p>Create two virtual terminals and
  execute a bash if <tt>ctrl-c</tt> is typed in the console
  terminal. The additional terminals can be accessed by typing
  <tt>Alt-F2</tt> or <tt>Alt-F3</tt>. Otherwise no terminals are
  available and typing <tt>ctrl-c</tt> will reboot the install
  client. Setting this flag is useful for debugging. If you want an
  installation which should not be interruptible, do not set this
  flag.</p> </item>

 <tag>reboot</tag> <item> <p>Reboot the install client after installation
 is finished without typing RETURN on the console. This is only useful if you can
 change the boot image or boot device automatically or your assembly robot
 can remove the boot floppy via remote control :-)
 Currently this should only be used when
 booting from network card.</p> </item>
</taglist>


<sect id=classc> The class concept<p>

Classes determine which configuration file to choose from a list of
available templates. Classes are used in all further tasks of the
installation. To determine which config file to use, an install
client searches the list of defined classes and uses all
configuration files that match a class name. It's also possible to use
only the configuration file with the highest priority since the order
of classes define the priority from low to high. There are some
predefined classes (DEFAULT, LAST and the hostname), but classes can
also be listed in a file or defined dynamically by scripts. So it's
easy to define a class depending on the subnet information or on some
hardware that is available on the install client.
<p>
The idea of using classes in general and using certain files matching
a class name for a configuration is adopted from the installation
scripts by Casper Dik for Solaris. This technique proved to be very
useful for the SUN workstations, so I also use it for the fully
automatic installation of Linux. One simple and very efficient feature
of Casper's scripts is to call a command with all files (or on the
first one) whose file
names are also a class. The following loop implements this function
in pseudo shell code:

<example>
   for class in $all_classes; do
   if [ -r $config_dir/$class ]; then
      your_command $config_dir/$class
      # exit if only the first matching file is needed
   fi
   done
</example>
Therefore it is possible to add a new file to
the configuration without changing the script. This is because the
loop automatically detects new configurations files that should be
used. Unfortunately cfengine does not support this nice feature, so
all classes being used in cfengine need also to be specified inside
the cfengine scripts. Classes are very important for the fully
automatic installation. If a client belongs to class <tt>A</tt>, we
say the class <tt>A</tt> is defined. A class has no value, it is just
defined or undefined. Within scripts, the variable <var>$classes</var>
holds a space separated list with the names of all defined classes.
Classes determine how the installation is performed. For example, an
install client can be configured to become a FTP server by just adding
the class <tt>FTP</tt> to it.

Mostly a configuration is created by only changing or appending the
classes to which a client belongs, making the installation of a new
client very easy. Thus no additional information needs to be added to
the configuration files if the existing classes suffice for your needs.
There are different possibilities to define classes:
<enumlist>
     <item><p>Some default classes are defined for every host:
     DEFAULT, LAST and its hostname.</p> </item>
     <item><p>Classes may be listed within a file.</p> </item>
     <item><p>Classes may be defined by scripts.</p> </item>
 </enumlist>

The last option is a very nice feature, since these scripts will
define classes automatically. For example, several classes are
defined only if certain hardware is identified. We use Perl and shell
scripts to define classes. All names of classes, except the hostname,
are written in uppercase. They must not contain a hyphen, a hash or a
dot, but may contain underscores. A description of all classes can be
found in <file>/usr/share/doc/fai/classes_description.txt</file>.
<p>

Hostnames should rarely be used for the configuration files in the
configuration space. Instead, a class should be defined and
then added for a given host. This is because most of the time the
configuration data is not specific for one host, but is can be shared
among several hosts.

<sect id=s2> Defining classes<p>

The task <em>defclass</em> calls the script <manref
name="fai-class" section="1"> to define classes. Therefore, scripts
matching <tt>[0-9][0-9]*</tt> in <tt>/fai/class</tt> are
executed. Additionally, a file with the hostname may contain a list of
classes. 
For more information on defining class, read the manual pages for <manref
name="fai-class" section="1">. <p>

The list of all defined classes is stored in the variable
<var>$classes</var> and saved to
<file>/tmp/fai/FAI_CLASSES</file>. The list of all classes is
transfered to <prgn>cfengine</prgn>, so it can use them too. The
script <file>10-base-classes</file> (below is a stripped version) is used to
define classes depending on the host name. First this script defines
the class with the name of the hardware architecture in uppercase
letters. 
<example>
# cat 10-base-classes

# echo architecture and OS name in upper case. Do NOT remove these two lines
uname -s | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'
dpkg --print-installation-architecture | tr /a-z/ /A-Z/

[ -f /boot/RUNNING_FROM_FAICD ] && echo "FAICD"

# use a list of classes for our demo machine
case $HOSTNAME in
    demohost)
        echo "FAIBASE GRUB DHCPC DEMO" ;;
    gnomehost)
        echo "FAIBASE GRUB DHCPC DEMO XFREE GNOME";;
    *)
        echo "FAIBASE GRUB DHCPC" ;;
esac
</example>

The script <tt>20-hwdetect.source</tt> uses the default Debian commands
to detect hardware and to load some kernel modules. If
some specific hardware is found, it can also define a new class for it.
You can find messages from modprobe in <file>/tmp/fai/kernel.log</file> and
on the fourth console terminal by pressing <tt>Alt-F4</tt>.<p>

<sect id=classvariables> Defining Variables<p>

The task <tt>defvar</tt> defines the variables for the install
client. Variables are defined by scripts in
<tt>class/*.var</tt>. All global variables can be set in
<file>DEFAULT.var</file>. For certain groups of hosts use a class file
or for a single host use the file
<var>$HOSTNAME</var><tt>.var</tt>. Also here, it's useful to study all
the examples.

The following variables are used in the examples and may be also useful
for your installation:

<taglist>
   <tag>FAI_ACTION</tag> <item> <p>Set the action fai should
   perform. Normally this is done by <manref name="fai-chboot"
  section="8">. If you can't use this command and are not using a
   BOOTP server, define it in the script <file>LAST.var</file>.

   <tag>FAI_CONSOLEFONT</tag> <item> <p>Is the font which is loaded during
   installation by <manref name="consolechars" section="8">.</p> </item>

   <tag>FAI_KEYMAP</tag> <item> <p>Defines the keyboard map files in
   <file>/usr/share/keymaps</file> and <file>$FAI/files</file>. You
   need not specify the complete path, since this file will be located
   automatically.</p> </item>

   <tag>rootpw</tag> <item> <p>The root encrypted password for the new
   system.</p> </item>

   <tag>UTC</tag> <item> <p>Set hardware clock to UTC if
   <tt>$UTC=yes</tt>. Otherwise set clock to local time. See <manref
   name="clock" section="8"> for more information.</p> </item>

   <tag>time_zone</tag> <item> <p>Is the file relative to
   <file>/usr/share/zoneinfo/</file> which indicates your time
   zone.</p> </item>

   <tag>moduleslist</tag> <item> <p>Can be a multi line
   definition. List of modules (including kernel parameters) which are
   loaded during boot of the new system (written to /etc/modules).</p>
   </item>

The format of the hard disk configuration files is described in
<file>/usr/share/doc/fai/README.disk_config.gz</file>. The config file
<file>/fai/disk_config/FAIBASE</file> is a generic description for
one hard disk (IDE or SCSI), which should fit for most installations. If you
can't partition your hard disk using this script <footnote><p>Currently
this script uses the command <tt>sfdisk(8)</tt>, which isn't available
on SUN SPARC, IA64 and PowerPC.</p> </footnote>, use a hook instead. The hook should
write the new partition table, create the file systems and create the
files <file>/tmp/fai/fstab</file> and <file>/tmp/fai/disk_var.sh</file>, which
contains definitions of boot and root partitions.
<p>

<sect id=packageconfig>Software package configuration<p>
The script <prgn>install_packages</prgn> installs the selected software
packages. It uses all configuration files in <file>/fai/package_config</file>
whose file name matches a defined class. The syntax is very
simple.

<example>
# an example package class

PACKAGES taskinst
german 

PACKAGES aptitude
adduser netstd ae
less passwd

PACKAGES remove
gpm xdm

PACKAGES aptitude GRUB
lilo- grub

PACKAGES dselect-upgrade
ddd                     install
a2ps                    install
</example>

Comments are starting with a hash (#) and are ending at the end of
the line. Every command begins with the word <tt>PACKAGES</tt>
followed by a command name. The command name is similar to those of
<prgn>apt-get</prgn>. Here's the list of supported command names:


<taglist>
<tag>hold:</tag> <item> <p>Put a package on hold. This package will
not be handled by dpkg, e.g not upgraded.</p> </item>

<tag>install:</tag> <item> <p>Install all packages that are specified
in the following lines. If a hyphen is appended to the package name
   (with no intervening space), the package will be removed, not
   installed. All package names are checked for misspellings. 
Any package which does not exist, will be removed from the list of
packages to install. So be careful not to misspell any package names.</p> </item>

<tag>remove:</tag> <item> <p>Remove all packages that are specified in
the following lines. Append a + to the package name if the package
should be installed.</p> </item>

<tag>taskinst:</tag> <item> <p>Install all packages belonging to the
task that are specified in the following lines using <manref
name="tasksel" section="1">. You can also use <tt>aptitude</tt> for
installing tasks.</p> </item>

<tag>aptitude:</tag> <item> <p>Install all packages with
the command <prgn>aptitude</prgn>. This will be the default in the future
and may replace apt-get and taskinst. Aptitude can also install task
packages.</p> </item>

<tag>aptitude-r:</tag> <item> <p>Same as aptitude with option
<tt>--with-recommends</tt>.

<tag>dselect-upgrade</tag> <item> <p> Set package selections using the
following lines and install or remove the packages specified. These
lines are the output of the command <tt>dpkg --get-selections</tt>.
</taglist>


Multiple lines with lists of space separated names of packages follows
the PACKAGES lines. All dependencies are resolved. Packages with
suffix <tt>-</tt> (eg. <tt>lilo-</tt>)will be removed instead of
installed. The order of the packages is of no matter.
<p>
A line which contains the <tt>PRELOADRM</tt> commands, downloads a
file using <manref name="wget" section="1"> into a directory before
installing the packages. Using the <tt>file:</tt> URL, this file is copied
from <var>$FAI_ROOT</var> to the download directory.
For examples the package
<prgn>realplayer</prgn> needs an archive to install the software, so
this archive is downloaded to the directory <file>/root</file>. After
installing the packages this file will be removed. If the file
shouldn't be removed, use the the command <tt>PRELOAD</tt> instead.

<p>
It's possible to append a list of class names after the command for
apt-get. So this <tt>PACKAGE</tt> command will only be executed when
the corresponding class is defined. So you can combine many small
files into the file DEFAULT. <tt>WARNING!</tt> Use this feature only
in the file DEFAULT to keep everything simple. See this file for some
examples.

<p>
If you specify a package that does not exists this package will be
removed from the installation list. You can also test all software package
configuration files with the utility <prgn>chkdebnames</prgn>, which
is available in <file>/usr/share/doc/fai/examples/utils/</file>.
<example>
> chkdebnames stable /usr/local/share/fai/package_config/*
</example>

<sect id=cscripts>Scripts in <tt>/fai/scripts</tt><p>

The default set of scripts in <file>/fai/scripts</file> is only an example. But
they should do a reasonable job for your installation. You can edit them
or add new scripts to match your local needs.
<p>
The command <manref name="fai-do-scripts" section="1"> is called to
execute all scripts in this directory. If a directory with a class
name exists, all scripts matching <file>[0-9][0-9]*</file> are executed in
alphabetical order. So it's possible to use scripts of different
lanuages (shell, cfengine, perl,..) for one class.

<sect1 id=shell>Shell scripts<p>

Most scripts are Bourne shell scripts. Shell scripts are useful if the
configuration task only needs to call some shell commands or create a
file from scratch. In order not to write many short scripts, it's
possible to distinguish classes within a script using the command
<tt>ifclass</tt>. For copying files with classes, use the command
<manref name="fcopy" section="8">. If you like to extract an archive
using classes, use <manref name="ftar" section="8">.
But now have a look at the scripts and see what they are doing.

<sect1 id=perl>Perl scripts<p>
Currently no Perl script is used for modifying the system
configuration.

<sect1 id=expect>Expect scripts<p>
Currently no expect scripts are used for modifying the system
configuration.

<sect1 id=cfengine>Cfengine scripts<p>

Cfengine has a rich set of functions to edit existing configuration
files, e.g <tt>LocateLineMatching, ReplaceAll, InsertLine,
AppendIfNoSuchLine, HashCommentLinesContaining</tt>. But it can't
handle variables which are undefined. If a variable is undefined,
the whole cfengine script will abort. Study the examples that are
included in the fai package.

More information can be found in the manual page <manref
name="cfengine" section="8"> or at the cfengine homepage
<httpsite>www.cfengine.org</httpsite>.


<sect id=changeboot>Changing the boot device<p>

Changing the boot sequence is normally done in the BIOS setup. But
you can't change the BIOS from a running Linux system as far as I
know. If you know how to perform this, please send me an email. But there's
another way of swapping the boot device of a running Linux system.
<p>
So, normally the boot sequence of the BIOS will remain unchanged and
your computer should always boot first from its network card and the
second boot device should be the local disk. Then, it will
get an install kernel image from the install server, when an
installation should be performed, or we can tell pxelinux to boot from
local disk. This is done using <manref name="fai-chboot" section="8">.

This is how to set up a 3Com network card as first boot device.
Enable LAN as first boot device in the BIOS.

<example>
Boot From LAN First: Enabled
Boot Sequence      : C only
</example>

Then enter the MBA setup of the 3Com network card and change it as follows:
<example>
Default Boot           Local
Local Boot             Enabled
Message Timeout        3 Seconds
Boot Failure Prompt    Wait for timeout
Boot Failure           Next boot device
</example>

This will enable the first IDE hard disk as second boot device after
the network card.

If booting from a FAI floppy disk, another solution can be used to skip a
re-installation if the BIOS is configured to boot from the floppy disk
first and you are not here to remove the floppy disk:
<example>
# lilo -R ...
</example>
will instruct the FAI floppy to boot from the hard disk only once (see
<manref name="lilo" section="8">). Thus after this first reboot, the FAI
floppy disk can be used for another FAI installation.


<sect id=hooks>Hooks<p>

Hooks let you specify functions or programs which are run at certain
steps of the installation process. Before a default task is called,
FAI searches for existing hooks for this task and executes them. As you
might expect, classes are also used when calling hooks. Hooks are
executed for every defined class. You only have to create the hook
with the name for the desired class and it will be used. If
<tt>debug</tt> is included in <var>$FAI_FLAG</var> the option
<tt>-d</tt> is passed to all hooks, so you can debug your own hooks.
If some default tasks should be skipped, use the subroutine
<tt>skiptask</tt> and a list of default tasks as parameters. The
example <file>partition.DISKLESS</file> skips some default tasks.
<p>


The directory <file>/fai/hooks/</file> contains all hooks. The file
name of a hook consists of a task name as a prefix and a class name,
separated by a dot. The prefix describes the time when the hook is
called, if the class is defined for the install client. For example,
the hook <file>partition.DISKLESS</file> is called for every client
belonging to the class <tt>DISKLESS</tt> before the local disks would
be partitioned. If it should become a diskless client, this hook
can mount remote filesystems via NFS and create a <tt>/tmp/fai/fstab</tt>.
After that, the installation process will not try to partition and
format a local hard disk, because a file <file>/tmp/fai/fstab</file>
already exists.
<p>
A hook of the form <tt>hookprefix.classname</tt>  can't define
variables for the installation script, because it's a subprocess. But
you can use any binary executable or any script you wrote. Hooks that
have the suffix <tt>.source</tt> (e.g. <file>partition.DEFAULT.source</file>) must
be Bourne shell scripts and are sourced. So it's possible to
redefine variables for the installation scripts.
<p>

In the first part of fai, all hooks with prefix <tt>confdir</tt> are called.
Since the configuration directory <file>/fai</file> is mounted in the
default task <tt>confdir</tt>, the hooks for this task are the only
hooks located in <var>$nfsroot</var><file>/fai/hooks</file> on the
install server. All other hooks are found in
<file>/usr/local/share/fai/hooks</file> on the install server.

All hooks that are called before classes are defined can only use the
following classes: <tt>DEFAULT $HOSTNAME LAST</tt>. If a hook for
class <tt>DEFAULT</tt> should only be called if no hook for class
<var>$HOSTNAME</var> is available, insert these lines to the default
hook:

<example>
hookexample.DEFAULT:

#! /bin/sh

# skip DEFAULT hook if a hook for $HOSTNAME exists
scriptname=$(basename $0 .DEFAULT)
[-f /fai/hooks/$scriptname.$HOSTNAME ] && exit
# here follows the actions for class DEFAULT
.
.
</example>


<p> Some examples for what hooks could be used:

<list>
<item> <p>Use <prgn>ssh</prgn> in the very beginning to verify that
you mounted the configuration from the correct server and not a
possible spoofing host.</p></item>

<item> <p>Do not mount the configuration directory, instead get a
compressed archive via HTTP or from floppy disk and extract it into a
new ram disk, then redefine <var>$FAI_LOCATION</var>.</p></item>

<item> <p>Load kernel modules before classes are defined
in <file>/fai/class</file>. </p></item>

<item> <p>Send an email to the administrator if the installation is finished.</p></item>

<item> <p>Install a diskless client and skip local disk
partitioning. See <file>hooks/partition.DISKLESS</file>.</p></item>

<item> <p>Partition the hard disk on an IA64 system, which needs a
special partition table type that must be created with <manref
name="parted" section="8">. See <file>hooks/partition.IA64</file>.</p></item>
</list>

<sect id=errors>Looking for errors<p>
If the client can't successfully boot from the network card, use
<manref name="tcpdump" section="8"> to look for Ethernet packets
between the install server and the client. Search also for entries in
several log files made by <manref name="tftpd" section="8">,
<manref name="dhcpd3" section="8"> or <manref name="bootpd" section="8">:

<example>egrep "tftpd|bootpd|dhcpd" /var/log/*</example>

If the installation process finishes, the hook
<file>faiend.LAST</file> searches all log files for common errors and
write them to the file <file>error.log</file>. So, you should first
look into this file for errors. Also the file <file>status.log</file>
give you the exit code of the last command executed in a script. To be
sure, you should look for errors in all log files.<p>

Sometimes the installation seems to stop, but often there's only a
postinstall script of a software package that requires manual input
from the console. Change to another virtual terminal and look which
process is running  with tools like <manref name="top" section="1"> and <manref
name="pstree" section="1">. You can add <tt>debug</tt> to
<tt>FAI_FLAGS</tt> to make the installation process show all output
from the postinst scripts on the console and get its input also from the
console. Don't hesitate to send an email to the mailing list or to
<email>fai@informatik.uni-koeln.de</email> if you have any
questions. Sample log files from successful installed computers are
available on the FAI homepage.

<chapt id=beowulf>How to build a Beowulf cluster using FAI<p>

This chapter describes the details about building a Beowulf
cluster using &dgl; and FAI. For more information about the Beowulf
concept look at <httpsite>www.beowulf.org</httpsite>. 

<sect id=beoplan> Planning the Beowulf setup<p>

The example of a Beowulf cluster consists of one master node and 25
clients. A big rack was assembled which all the cases were put into. A
keyboard and a monitor, which are connected to the master server
most of the time, were also put into the rack. But since we have very long
cables for a monitor and a keyboard, they can also be connected to all
nodes if something has to be changed in the BIOS, or when looking for
errors when a node does not boot. Power supply is another topic you
have to think about. Don't connect many nodes to one power cord and
one outlet. Distribute them among several breakout boxes and outlets.
And what about the heat emission? A dozen nodes in a small room can
create too much heat, so you will need an air conditioner. Will the
power supplies of each node go to stand-by mode or are all nodes
turned on simultaneously after a power failure?

<p>
All computers in this example are connected to a Fast Ethernet switch. The master node
(or master server) is called <em>nucleus</em>. It has two network
cards. One for the connection to the external Internet, one for the
connection to the internal cluster network. If connected from the
external Internet, it's called <em>nucleus</em>, but the cluster nodes
access the master node with the name <em>atom00</em>, which is a name
for the second network interface. The master server is also the
install server for the computing nodes. A local Debian mirror will be
installed on the local harddisk. The home directories of all user
accounts is also located on the master server. It will be exported via
NFS to all computing nodes. NIS will be used to distribute account,
host, and printer information to all nodes.

<p>
All client nodes <em>atom01</em> to <em>atom25</em> are connected via
the switch with the second interface card of the master node. They can
only connect to the other nodes or the master, but can't communicate
to any host outside their cluster network. So, all services (NTP, DNS,
NIS, NFS, ...) must be available on the master server. I choose the class C
network address <em>192.168.42.0</em> for building the local Beowulf
cluster network. You can replace the subnet 42 with any other number
you like. If you have more than 253 computing nodes, choose a class A
network address (10.X.X.X).

<p>
In the phase of preparing the installation, you have to boot the first
install client many time, until there's no fault in your configuration
scripts. Therefore you should have physical access to the master
server and one client node. So, connect both computers to a switch
box, so one keyboard and monitor can be shared among both.

<sect id=master> Set up the master server<p>

The master server will be installed by hand if it is your first
computer installed with Debian. If you already have a host running
Debian, you can also install the master server via FAI. Create a
partition on <file>/files/scratch/debmirror</file> for the local
Debian mirror with more than &mirrorsize GB space available.

<sect1 id=beonetworkmaster> Set up the network<p>

Add the following lines for the second network card to
<file>/etc/network/interfaces</file>:
<example>
# Beowulf cluster connection
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
address 192.168.42.250
netmask 255.255.255.0
broadcast 192.168.42.255
</example>

Add the IP addresses for the client nodes. The FAI package has an
example for this <file>/etc/hosts</file> file:
<example>
# create these entries with the perl one liner
# perl -e 'for (1..25) {printf "192.168.42.%s atom%02s\n",$_,$_;}'

# Beowulf nodes
# atom00 is the master server
192.168.42.250 atom00
192.168.42.1 atom01
192.168.42.2 atom02
</example>

You can give the internal Beowulf network a name when you add this
line to <file>/etc/networks</file>:
<example>beowcluster 192.168.42.0</example>


Activate the second network interface with: <tt>/etc/init.d/networking start</tt>.

<sect1 id=beonis> Setting up NIS<p>

Add a normal user account <var>tom</var> which is the person who edits
the configuration space and manages the local Debian mirror:
<example># adduser tom
# addgroup linuxadmin
</example>

This user should also be in the group <var>linuxadmin</var>.
<example>
# adduser tom linuxadmin
</example>

First set the NIS domainname name by creating the file
<file>/etc/defaultdomain</file> and call <manref name="domainname" section="8">.
To initialize the master server as NIS server call <tt>/usr/lib/yp/ypinit -m</tt>.
Also edit <file>/etc/default/nis</file> so the host becomes a NIS
master server.
Then, copy the file <file>netgroup</file> from the examples directory
to <file>/etc</file> and edit other files there. Adjust access to the
NIS service.

<example># cat /etc/ypserv.securenets
# Always allow access for localhost
255.0.0.0       127.0.0.0
# This line gives access to the Beowulf cluster
255.255.255.0 192.168.42.0
</example>

Rebuild the NIS maps:
<example># cd /var/yp; make</example>

You will find much more information about NIS in the
<file>NIS-HOWTO</file> document.

<sect1 id=beomirror> Create a local Debian mirror<p>

Now the user <var>tom</var> can create a local Debian mirror on
<file>/files/scratch/debmirror</file> using
<prgn>mkdebmirror</prgn>. You can add the option <tt>--debug</tt> to
see which files are received. This will
need about &mirrorsize GB disk space for Debian 3.0 (aka woody). Export this
directory to the netgroup <tt>@faiclients</tt> read only.
Here's the line for <file>/etc/exports</file>
<p><tt>/files/scratch/debmirror *(ro)</tt>

<sect1 id=fai1> Install FAI package on the master server<p>

Add the following packages to the install server:
<example>nucleus:/# apt-get install ntp tftpd-hpa dhcp3-server \
nfs-kernel-server etherwake fai fai-kernels
nucleus:/# tasksel -q -n install dns-server
nucleus:/# apt-get dselect-upgrade
</example>
Configure NTP so that the master server will have the correct system time.

<p>
It's very important to use the internal network name <var>atom00</var>
 for the master sever (not the external name <var>nucleus</var>) in
 <file>/etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf</file> and &mfnc;. Replace
 the strings FAISERVER with <tt>atom00</tt> and uncomment the following line in &mfnc;
 so the Beowulf nodes can use the name for connecting their master server.
<example>
NFSROOT_ETC_HOSTS="192.168.42.250 atom00"
</example>

<sect1 id=bootp1> Prepare network booting<p>

Set up the install server daemon as described in <ref
id="pxeboot">. If you will have many cluster nodes (more than about
10) and you will use <tt>rsh</tt> in &fc; raise the number of connects
per minute to some services in <file>inetd.conf</file>:
<example>
shell stream tcp  nowait.300  root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/in.rshd
login stream tcp  nowait.300  root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/in.rlogind
</example>

The user <var>tom</var> should have permission to create the
symlinks for booting via network card, so change the group and add
some utilities.

<example># chgrp -R linuxadmin /boot/fai; chmod -R g+rwx /boot/fai
# cp /usr/share/doc/fai/examples/utils/* /usr/local/bin
</example>

Now, the user <var>tom</var> set the boot image for the first beowulf
node.
<example>fai-chboot -IFv atom01</example>

Now boot the first client node for the first
time. Then start to adjust the configuration for your client
nodes. Don't forget to build the kernel for the cluster nodes using
<manref name="make-kpkg" section="8"> and store it in <file>/usr/local/share/fai/files/packages</file>.

<sect id=beotools> Tools for Beowulf clusters<p>

The following tools are useful for a Beowulf cluster:

<taglist>
	  <tag> tlink <item> <p>Change the symbolic link that points to
	  the kernel image for booting from a network card. Only used
	  when you boot using BOOTP.</p></item>

	  <tag> all_hosts <item> <p>Print a list of all hosts, print
	  only the hosts which respond to a ping or the hosts which
	  do not respond. The complete list of hosts is defined by the
	  netgroup <tt>allhosts</tt>. Look at
	  <file>/usr/share/doc/fai/examples/etc/netgroup</file> for an
	  example.</p></item>

	<tag>rshall<item><p>Execute a command on all hosts which are
	up via rsh. Uses <prgn>all_hosts</prgn> to get the list of all
	hosts up. You can also use the <manref name="dsh" section="1">
	command (dancer's shell, or distributed shell).

	<tag>rup<item><p> The command <manref name="rup" section="1">
	shows briefly the CPU load of every host.

	<tag>clusterssh<item><p> The package clusterssh allows you to
	control multiple ssh or rsh sessions at the same time.

</taglist>
These are some common tools for a cluster environment:

<taglist>
  <tag>rgang</tag> <item> <p>For a huge cluster try
  <prgn>rgang</prgn>. It's is a tool which executes commands on or
  distributes files to many nodes. It uses an algorithm to build a
  tree-like structure to allow the distribution processing time to
  scale very well to 1000 or more nodes (available at
  <httpsite>fermitools.fnal.gov/</httpsite>
  <httppath>abstracts/rgang/abstract.html</httppath>). </p></item>

  <tag>jmon</tag><item><p>For observing the resources of all
  clients (CPU, memory, swap,...)  you can use <manref

<sect id=wol> Wake on LAN with 3Com network cards<p>

Wake on LAN is a very nice feature to power on a computer without
having physical access to it. By sending a special ethernet packet to
the network card, the computer will be turned on. The following things
have to be done, to use the wake on LAN (WOL) feature.<p>

<enumlist>
<item><p>Connect the network card to the Wake-On-LAN connector on the
motherboard using a 3 pin cable.</p></item>
 <item><p>My ASUS K7M motherboard has a jumper called
<tt>Vaux (3VSBSLT)</tt> which allows to select the voltage supplied to add-in
PCI cards. Set it to <tt>Add 3VSB</tt> (3 Volt stand by).</p></item>
<item><p>Turn on the wake on LAN feature in BIOS</p></item>
<item><p>For a 3Com card using the 3c59x driver you must enable the
WOL feature using the kernel module option <tt>enable_wol</tt>.
</enumlist>

To wake up a computer use the command <manref name="ether-wake" section="8">.
Additional information is available from
<httpsite>www.scyld.com/</httpsite><httppath>expert/wake-on-lan.html</httppath>.

<chapt id=arch>FAI on other architectures and distributions<p>
If you want to use FAI on other architectures than i386 you might need
to take care for some things yourself.

These are things that may have to be changed on other architectures:

<taglist>
   <tag> make-nfsroot.conf <item> <p>FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP_OPTS must be adopted to the
   architecture you're using.</p>

   <tag> task partition: <item> <p>Currently setup_harddisks
   needs the command <manref name="sfdisk" section="8">. If
   this is not available then write a short shell script which
   uses <manref name="parted" section="8">, to partition the disks and
   for creating the file <file>fstab</file>. Alternatively you use a 
   hook (see <ref id="hooks">) to format and mount your partitions.

   <tag> Boot loader: <item> <p> There are scripts for setting up
 <manref name="lilo" section="8"> and <manref name="grub" section="8">. Here you may
   add support for your specific boot loader.
</taglist>

If you want to serve multiple nfsroot directories on one FAI server,
you need to create specific config directories in <file>/etc</file>
for fai, like <file>/etc/fai-sarge</file> and
<file>/etc/fai-etch</file>. Then you need to set the
<var>NFSROOT</var> variables to different directories and run
<tt>make-fai-nfsroot -c /etc/fai-sarge</tt>.

<sect id=amd64>FAI on AMD64<p>
No problems. Have a look at
<httpsite>www.informatik.uni-koeln.de</httpsite><httppath>/fai/download/amd64/</httppath>

<sect id=powerpc>FAI on PowerPC<p>
There's some stuff on <httpsite>www.layer-acht.org</httpsite><httppath>/fai</httppath>. 
Most notably there are hooks for partitioning and config-files to 
setup bootloaders for oldworld and newworld. 

<sect id=ia64>FAI on IA64<p>
There's one big IA64 Beowulf cluster running which was installed with
FAI. Only the partitioning part has to be replaced by a short script,
since sfdisk is not available on IA64.

<sect id=alpha>FAI on Alpha<p>
There is a Mini-HowTo available at
<httpsite>pandora.aei.mpg.de</httpsite><httppath>/~steffeng/fai/fai-alpha.html</httppath>

<sect id=odists>FAI for Suse, Redhat and Gentoo<p>
Many people are interested in FAI for other (mostly rpm based) Linux
distributions. I made some research and it should be not much work to
realize it. But I need more help to implement it. If you are
interested and like to help me, please send an email to
<email>fai@informatik.uni-koeln.de</email>.

<sect id=sparc>FAI on SUN SPARC hardware running Linux<p>

Although FAI is architecture independent, there are some packages which
are only available for certain architectures (e.g. silo, sparc-utils).

SUN SPARC computers can boot from their boot prompt and don't need a
boot floppy. To boot a SUN use: <example>boot net:dhcp - ip=::::::dhcp</example>


You have to convert the kernel image from ELF format to a.out
format. Use the program <prgn>elftoaout</prgn> (mentioned in
the FAQ). The symlink to the kernel image to be booted is not the host
name. Look at the FAQ at
<httpsite>www.ultralinux.org</httpsite> for more information
and <httpsite>www.sparc-boot.org/</httpsite>.
.

A success report is available at
<httpsite>www.opossum.ch/</httpsite><httppath>fai/</httppath>
and a HOWTO and a lot of examples can be found at
<httpsite>toolbox.rutgers.edu/</httpsite><httppath>~amurphy/fai</httppath>.

<sect id=solaris>FAI for Solaris<p>
FAI is also ported to use with SUN Solaris OS installations. It is
used in cooperation with Solaris jumpstart.
Get the FAI sources and change to directory <file>sunos</file>. There
you can call <tt>make</tt> which creates the tarball
<file>/tmp/fai-solaris.tar.gz</file>. You have to read the file
<file>README.sunos</file> and have some knowledge about Solaris
jumpstart.
<p>
The file format of the configuration files in <file>disk_config</file> and
<file>package_config</file> are different than those for Linux.

<sect id=generalscm>Using revision control for FAI configuration<p>
If there is a team of administrators involved, a revision control/sourcecode
management system like CVS can make coordination easier: many people can 
work on the configuration files simultaneously, while the system helps
avoiding conflicts (and if they occur it helps resolving them). Another
advantage lies in <em>branching</em>: while the administrator works out a 
new configuration and tries it out using a test system, other clients aren't
disturbed in any way, because they use another <em>branch</em> of the
configuration. </p>
<sect1 id=cvs>Setting up FAI for CVS based configuration<p>
First you should setup a CVS repository and within it a module to store the
FAI configuration files. In this example a cvs pserver will be used for
<em>read-only</em> access to the configuration files by the clients, while
ssh is used for the developers access (rw)<footnote>CVS is quite flexible 
when it comes to different methods of access, so I recommend you to read 
further documentation to find the optimal solution in your
environment</footnote>. </p>

<p>The relevant variables in &fc and &mfnc; for CVS are:
<taglist>
  <tag><var>FAI_LOCATION</var></tag>
    <item>
    This variable <strong>must not</strong> be set if you want to use CVS.
    </item>
  <tag><var>FAI_CVSROOT</var></tag>
    <item>
    contains the cvsroot where the configuration is stored.
	<example>
	FAI_CVSROOT=":pserver:client@cvs.local.net:/var/lib/cvs"
	</example>
    </item>
  <tag><var>FAI_CVSMODULE</var></tag>
    <item>
      contains the module in the cvsroot where the configuration is stored.
	<example>
	FAI_CVSMODULE="config"
	</example>
    </item>
  <tag><var>FAI_CVSTAG</var></tag>
    <item>
      contains the <em>tag</em> of the cvs branch to
      be checked out by the client<footnote>This is optional: if not set,
      <em>HEAD</em> will be used, which corresponds to the most recent
      revision the configuration</footnote>.
	<example>
	FAI_CVSTAG="STABLE"
	</example>
    </item>
<!--  <tag><var>FAI</var></tag>
    <item><p>
      Before checking out the configuration, the code copies the contents of
      this directory after a sanity check (i
      to <file>/tmp/$FAI_CVSMODULE</file>, then enters the
      directory and does a <example>cvs update</example> instead of a
      <example>cvs checkout</example>. This behaviour is used in connection
      with system updates to record the changes within configuration files.
    </p></item>
    -->
</taglist></p>

<p> If you use a cvs pserver for storing configuration files, the file
<file>/root/.cvspass</file> has to exist and be valid in the nfsroot. CVS
uses this file to get the password for the pserver. You can create it most
easiely if you try <example>cvs -d$FAI_CVSROOT login</example> and then copy
the generated line from your <file>~/.cvspass</file> into
<file>/root/.cvspass</file> in the nfsroot.</p>
</sect1>
</sect>

<sect id=softupdate>Using FAI for on-line updates
<p>FAI is even usable for system updates, using the same configuration
as if initially installing. System updates means update the running
system without doing a reinstallation. An updated client will almost
look like a newly installed machine, though all local data is
preserved (except of course newer configuration files introduced in
the FAI config).</p>

<sect1 id=aboutsoftupdate>How does a softupdate work?
<p>Softupdates are using the same configuration files as a new FAI installation. They
even use the default FAI commands, so they behave <em>nearly</em> in
the same way as an installation, tough some things are different:
<list>
	<item>By default the old list of classes (created during the
	initial installation) is used, so <prgn>fai-class</prgn>
	is not called to define a new list of classes. This can be
	changed by calling <tt>fai -N softupdate</tt>.</item>
	<item>No partitioning and filesystem creation is performed</item>
	<item>The basesytem isn't bootstrapped</item>
	<item>FAI skips tasks only useful when installing, such as setting up
		a keymap or starting special daemons</item>
	<item>FAI doesn't prevent software packages to (re-)start daemons</item>
	<item>FAI doesn't reboot at the end of a softupdate</item>
</list>
Except these changes, things are the same as when installing a new computer: 
<enumlist>
	<item>define classes (by default use old list) and variables</item>
	<item>update the installed packages</item>
	<item>install new software</item>
	<item>call configuration scripts</item>
	<item>save the logfiles</item>
</enumlist>
</sect1>

<sect1 id=runsoftupdate>How to run a softupdate
<p>As softupdates use the same infrastructure as a FAI installation, you even
start them by using the same command <manref name="fai" section="8"> which is used for
installation:
	<example>
		/usr/sbin/fai softupdate
	</example>
starts a softupdate.</p>

<sect2 id=startsoftupdate>How to do mass softupdates
<p>Probably you don't want to run to each client and start a softupdate there
locally, so a mechanism to start an update there has to be thought of.</p>

<sect3 id=cronsoftupdate>Cron
<p>One possible solution is to use crontab entries on the clients to start an
update, but in big installations you have to consider including a random-delay
mechanism, because too many updates at the same time may produce too much
traffic on your network.</p>

<sect3 id=remotesoftupdate>Starting a softupdate remotely
<p>If you want more control on when exactly a softupdate is run on the clients
and maybe want to monitor it while it is running, you can install remote root
login mechanism on your clients, preferably using ssh in connection with a
authorized key for root logins.</p>
<p>Tools like <tt>clusterssh</tt> allow you to login onto a group of clients at
once and run <tt>/usr/sbin/fai softupdate</tt> there, while the results can be
seen immediately in the terminals started for each host.</p>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id=confsoftupdate>How to write a configuration suitable for softupdates
<p>When you want to do softupdates, you have to be even more careful when
writing your configuration: it has to be <strong>idempotent</strong>, i.e. 
running all the scripts twice should result in the same system configuration
as running them once. Some things to keep an eye on:
<list>
	<item><em>Never</em> blindly append to files:
		<example>
			echo $SOMETHING >> /etc/fstab
		</example>
		is almost certainly wrong. Either check manually if the
		line already exists <strong>before</strong> appending or use 
		cfengine's <tt>AppendIfNoSuchLine</tt> statement 
		instead.</item>

	<item>Make use of FAI's environment variables to determine what to do in
		your configuration scripts! Some of the most important ones:
		<taglist>
			<tag><var>FAI_ROOT</var></tag>
				<item>points to the client's rootdir.
					In case of softupdates: <tt>/</tt></item>
			<tag><var>ROOTCMD</var></tag>
				<item>contains a command for <tt>chrooting</tt>
					into the client. This is empty when doing
					softupdates (as <tt>/</tt> is already our
					root...).</item>
			<tag><var>FAI_ACTION</var></tag>
				<item>contains the currently executed action:
					<taglist>
						<tag><tt>install</tt></tag>
							<item>when installing.</item>
						<tag><tt>softupdate</tt></tag>
							<item>when updating</item>
					</taglist>
		</taglist>

	<item>Restart daemons if needed: most daemons only read their
		configuration when starting; if you modify it, you need to
		make them reload it using
		<example>
			$ROOTCMD invoke-rc.d $somedaemon reload
		</example>
		or even restart them
		<example>
			$ROOTCMD invoke-rc.d $somedaemon restart
		</example>
		when the configuration for <tt>$somedaemon</tt> has been
		changed<footnote>You can for example use <manref
		name="fcopy" section="8">'s
		<tt>postinst</tt> script support for doing this; if other
		things than <tt>fcopy</tt> modify your conffiles, you have to
		keep track of the changes for yourself</footnote>.
		</item>

	<item>Other things like scheduling a reboot if a new kernel is installed</item>
</list></p>
</sect1>

<sect1 id=localconfsoftupdate>What if there are locally changed conffiles?
<p><strong>Short: there shouldn't be any!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Long: </strong> <em>if</em> you are using FAI <tt>softupdate</tt> to
update client's configuration, you shouldn't do any local changes on
the install clients, because they may be lost while updating. Backup
copies are done by fcopy only on the local disk (by default, they are
written to the same directory as the original file, with
<tt>.pre_fcopy</tt> appended); if you want to save them together with
the logfiles,
	<example>
		FAI_BACKUPDIR=$LOGDIR/backup
	</example>
in <tt>class/DEFAULT.var</tt> will do the job.</p>

<sect2 id=detectlocalchanges>How to detect locally changed files?
<p>If you are playing with local configuration changes <em>despite all the warnings
contained in this section</em>, there must be a way to check what has been
changed locally. A simple approach would be to use <tt>debsums -e</tt>,
but this method fails miserably if you modify conffiles in your FAI scripts,
because it only checks against the version contained in the debian package. A
better proposal is to setup/abuse <tt>tripwire</tt> or <tt>integrit</tt> to scan
for local changes and notify you about them.</p>

<chapt id=hints>Various hints<p>

This chapter has various hints which may not always be explained in great
detail.
<p>
When using HTTP access to a Debian mirror, the local <tt>/var</tt>
partition on all install clients must be big enough to keep the
downloaded Debian packages. Do not try with less than 250 Mbytes
unless you know why. You can limit the number of packages installed at
a time with the variable <var>$MAXPACKAGES</var>.
<p>
You can shorten some scripts if you will just use one single fcopy
command <tt>fcopy -r /</tt>.
<p>
You can merge two directories which contain configuration
information, if one is a global one, and the other a local one. We use
it to merge the templates from the fai package, and our local
configuration, which contains encrypted passwords and other
information that should not be readable for others. 
If you remove a file in you local configuration, do not forget to
remove this file also in the configuration space, otherwise it will
still be used.
<p>
After calling <prgn>set-disk-info</prgn>, a list of all local hard disks is
stored to <var>$disklist</var> and <var>$device_size</var>
contains a list of disk devices and their sizes.
<p>


Use <prgn>fai-divert -a</prgn> if a postinst script calls a
configuration program, e.g. the postinst script for package apache calls
apacheconfig, which needs manual input. You can fake the configuration
program so the installation can be fully automatic. But don't forget
to use <prgn>fai-divert -R</prgn> to remove all faked script.

<p>
During the installation you can execute commands
inside the newly installed system in a chroot environment by using <tt>chroot /tmp/target</tt>
or just <tt>$ROOTCMD</tt> followed by the command you want to call; for
example <tt>$ROOTCMD dpkg -l</tt> shows the packages installed on
the new system.
<p>

The only task which has to be done manually for new hardware is to
assign the MAC address to a hostname and to an IP address, and to define
classes for this host if the existing configuration files are not generic
enough to deal with this new host.
<p>
There's a tradeoff between writing a few large configuration scripts,
or many short scripts, one for each class. Large scripts can
distinguish classes by using case statements, the <tt>ifclass</tt>
test or with class mechanisms for <tt>cfengine</tt> scripts.
<p>
If your computer can't boot from the network card, you do not always need to boot
from floppy. Add  the class
<tt>FAI_BOOTPART</tt> and FAI will automatically create a
lilo or grub entry for
booting the FAI bootfloppy from this partition. So you can start the
re-installation without a boot floppy. This will also make the test
phase shorter, since booting from hard disk is much  faster than booting
from floppy. You can also set a password for this boot menu.
<p>

<sect id=difai>Using FAI after an Installation with the Debian-Installer<p>
On <httpsite>www.layer-acht.org</httpsite><httppath>/fai</httppath> you 
will find an example how to fully automaticly install a system using the Debian 
Installer (d-i) in conjunction with FAI's new softupdate (see <ref id=softupdate>). 

<sect id=functions>Useful functions for advanced administrators<p>

<taglist>
<tag>fai-divert</tag> <item> <p>Add or remove a file to the list of diversions
and replace the file with a dummy script. This is useful when a
