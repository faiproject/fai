<chapt id="motivation">Motivation<p>
There was lot of motivation for creating FAI ! TODO ...

<chapt id="overview">Overview and concepts of FAI<p>
<p>
FAI is a non interactive system to install a &dgl operating system on
a single computer or a whole cluster. You can take one or more virgin
PC's, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed,
configured and running on the whole cluster, without any interaction
necessary. Thus it's a scalable method for installing and updating a
cluster unattended with little effort involved. FAI uses the &dgl;
distribution and a collection of shell- and Perl-scripts for the
installation process. Changes to the configuration files of the
operating system are made by cfengine, shell and perl scripts.

<p>
FAI's target group are system administrators how have to install
Debian onto one or even hundreds of computers. Because it's a general
purpose installation tool, it can be used for installing a beowulf
cluster, a rendering farm or a linux laboratory or a classroom. Also
large-scale linux networks with different hardware or different installation
requirements are easy to establish using FAI.



First, some terms used
in this manual are described.

<taglist>
	  <tag> install server : <item> The host where the package FAI
	  is installed. It provides several services for all install clients. </item>
	  <tag>install client : <item> The host which will be installed using
	  FAI and a configuration from the install server. Also called
	  client for short.</p> </item>
	  <tag> nfsroot : <item> A filesystem located on the install
	  server. It's the complete filesystem for the install
	  client, which is mounted by the client during booting.</item>

	  <tag> configuration : <item> The details of how the installation
	  of the clients should be performed. This includes information about:
<list>
		<item> <p>Disk layout</p> </item>
		<item> <p>Local filesystems</p> </item>
		<item> <p>Software packages</p>	</item>
		<item> <p>Keyboard layout, time zone, NIS,
		X11 configuration, remote filesystems, user accounts,
		printers ...</p>	</item>
</list>
</taglist>

<sect id="work">How does FAI work ?<p> 

The computer which will be installed using FAI (called client) is
booted from floppy disk or via network card. It gets an IP-address and
boots a linux kernel which mounts all filesystems via NFS from a
server. After the operating system is running the FAI startup script
performs the automatic installation which doesn't need any
interaction. First, the hard disks will be partitioned, filesystems are
created and then software packages will be installed. Then the new
installed operating system is configured to your local needs. Finally
the new system will be booted from the local disk. 
<p>
The details of how to install the computer (the configuration) are stored in the
configuration space on the server. Configuration files are shared
among multiple computers if the are similar, so you need not to create a
configuration for every new host. Hence FAI is a scalable method to
install a big cluster with a great number of nodes.

<p>
FAI can also be used as an network rescue system. You can boot your
computer without performing an installation. Instead it will run a
fully functional &dgl without using the local hardisks. Then you can
do remote login and perform backups, restore data, check filesystem,
inspect the hardware or do any other task.

<chapt id="inst">Installing FAI
<sect id="requirements">Requirements<p> 

Following items are required for an installation via FAI.

<taglist>
	  <tag>BOOTP or DHCP server <item> The clients need one of
	  these daemons to obtain information. </item>
	  <tag>TFTP server	  <item> The TFTP daemon is used for
	  transfering the kernel to the clients when booting from network card.</item>
	  <tag>Debian mirror	  <item> Fast access to a Debian
	  mirror is needed. A local mirror of all Debian
	  packages is recommended if you install multiple computers.</item>
	  <tag>install kernel image <item> A kernel image that supports the
	  network card and mounts its root filesystem via NFS. </item>
	  <tag>Configuration space<item> A mountable directory which contains the configuration data. </item>
	</taglist>
<p>

The TFTP daemon and a nfs server will be enabled
automatically. Different install kernel images for BOOTP and DHCP are
available within the package. All clients must have a network card,
which is recognized by the kernel.
<p>

The FAI package is available as a Debian package from &faidownload;
until it will become an official Debian package (coming soon
;-)). 


<sect id=aptsetup> Setting up FAI
<p>

First, get the newest version of FAI and install it using the
<prgn>dpkg</prgn> command:

<example>
kueppers[~]# dpkg -i fai_1.4.1_i386.deb
Selecting previously deselected package fai.
(Reading database ... 39564 files and directories currently installed.)
Unpacking fai (from fai_1.4.1_i386.deb) ...
Setting up fai (1.4.1) ...
To set up FAI edit /etc/fai.conf and call fai-setup
</example>
<p>

Most definitions for FAI are defined in
&fc;. Since FAI doesn't use <prgn>debconf</prgn>
yet, edit this file and call <prgn>fai-setup</prgn>.
These are important variables in &fc;:

<taglist>
	    <tag><var>FAI_BASETGZ</var></tag>
	    <item>
	      <p>For building the nfsroot, the base system is
	      needed. It requires a <em>base</em> file (&basetgz),
	      which is a minimal collection of all required packages
	      for Debian. This is the location, where this big file
	      (&basetgzsize for &basetgz) is fetched from. It is not
	      used, when a file &basetgz is available in
	      <file>/tmp</file>. This could take much time, a ftp
	      server is used and you do not have a fast connection to
	      it. You can find the current version in the directory
	      <tt>debian/dists/stable/main/disks-i386/current/</tt> of
	      your Debian mirror.</p>
	    </item>

	    <tag><var>FAI_SOURCES_LIST</var></tag>
	    <item>
	      <p>This multi line string is the definition for
<file>sources.list</file>, which defines the location, how to access a
the Debian mirror. For more information on the file format see <manref
name="sources.list" section="5">.  </p> </item>

	    <tag><var>FAI_PACKAGE_DIR</var></tag>
	    <item>
	      <p> If you have NFS access to your local Debian mirror,
	      specify the remote filesystem. It will be mounted to
	      <var>$MNTPOINT</var>. It's not needed if you use FTP or
	      HTTP access.</p> </item>

	    <tag><var>KERNELPACKAGE</var></tag>
	    <item>
	      <p> You must specify a kernel package, which includes
	      the default kernel used during installation process. The
	      package <package>fai-kernels</package> contains the
	      default kernels for BOOTP and DHCP support.</item>
	  </taglist>

FAI uses <prgn>apt-get</prgn> to create the nfsroot filesystem which
needs about &nfsrootsize of free disk space. Additional software packages for
nfsroot are defined by the variable <var>NFSROOT_PACKAGES</var>.
<p>

You should also install the package <package>fai-kernels</package>,
which will automaticlly install when you use <prgn>apt-get</prgn> for
package isntallation.
<example>
kueppers[~]# dpkg -i ~lange/fai-kernels_1.0_i386.deb 
Selecting previously deselected package fai-kernels.
(Reading database ... 40562 files and directories currently installed.)
Unpacking fai-kernels (from .../lange/fai-kernels_1.0_i386.deb) ...
Setting up fai-kernels (1.0) ...
</example>

Before setting up FAI, you should get the program <prgn>imggen</prgn>,
if you like to boot from 3 network card from 3Com. This executable
converts netboot images, so they can be booted by 3Com cards. You can
get this compiled program from the download page &faidownload;. Put
that executable in your path (e.g. <file>/usr/local/bin</file>). After
editing &fc call <prgn>fai-setup</prgn>.

<example>
kueppers[/home/lange]# fai-setup 
Adding system user fai...
Stopping Name Service Cache Daemon: nscd.
Adding new user fai (100) with group nogroup.

Adding MBA support...
MBA support has been succesfully added 
You have no FAI configuration. Copy FAI template files with:
cp -pR /usr/share/doc/fai/templates/* /usr/local/share/fai
Then change the configuration files to meet your local needs.
FAI setup finished.
</example>

The installation process adds lines to <file>/etc/exports</file> to
export some directories to all hosts that belong to the netgroup
<em>faiclients</em>. Netgroups are defined in
<file>/etc/netgroup</file> or in the correspondening NIS map. An
example for the netgroup file can be found
<file>/usr/share/doc/fai/examples/etc/netgroup</file>. For more
information read the manual pages <manref name="netgroup" section="5">
and the NIS HOWTO. After changing the netgroups the nfs server has to
reload its configuration.

<example>
/etc/init.d/nfs-*server reload
</example>

<p>
After that, FAI is installed successfully on your server, but has no
configuration for the install clients. Start with the templates from
<tt> /usr/share/doc/fai/templates</tt> using the copy command above
and read <ref id="config">.
<p>
When you make changes to &fc or want to install a new kernel to
nfsroot, the nfsroot has be be rebuild by calling <prgn>fai-setup</prgn>.

<chapt id="booting">Booting hosts <p>

Now it's time to boot your install clients for the first time. You can
use the boot floppy or configure them to boot via network card, which
is much smarter. They will fail to boot, because no BOOTP or DHCP
daemon is running yet or recognizes the hosts. But you can use this
first boot attempt to easily collect all ethernet addresse of the
network cards.

<sect id="bootfloppy">Creating the boot floppy
<p>
If your network card can't boot itself, you have to boot via
floppy. Use the command
<prgn>make-fai-bootfloppy</prgn> to creates a suitable bootfloppy
for all install clients. There's no host specific information on this
floppy, so it's suitable for all your install clients.

<sect id="bootnetwork">Set up booting via network card
<p>
You will find two install kernels in <file>/boot/fai</file>. Make a
symbolic link from the hostname of your client to the appropriate
kernel image. The file <file>installimage_3com</file> is created by
<prgn>imggen</prgn> and suitable for booting 3Com network cards.

<example> 
# cd /boot/fai
# ln -s installimage_3com faiserver
</example>


<sect id="mac">Collecting ethernet addresses
<p>
You have to collect all ethernet (MAC) addresse of the install clients
and assign a hostname and IP-address to each client. So we first
collect all MAC addresses. Now boot all your install clients. While the
install client is booting, it sends broadcast packets to the LAN. You
can log the MAC addresses of these hosts, if following
command is running simultaneously on the server:

<example># tcpdump -qte broadcast and port bootpc >/tmp/mac.lis</example>

After the hosts has been send some broadcast packets (they will fail
to boot because <prgn>bootpd</prgn> isn't running or does not recognise the MAC
address yet) you abort <prgn>tcpdump</prgn> by typing <tt>ctrl-c</tt>. You get a list
of all unique MAC addresses with these commands:

<example># perl -ane 'print "\U$F[0]\n"' /tmp/mac.lis|sort|uniq</example>

After that, you only have to assign these MAC addresses to hostnames and
IP-addresses (<file>/etc/ethers</file> and <file>/etc/hosts</file> or
corresponding NIS maps). With these information you can configure your
<prgn>BOOTP</prgn> or <prgn>DHCP</prgn> daemon (see the section <ref id="bootptab">).

I recommend to write the MAC addresses (last three bytes will suffice
if you have network card from the same vendor) and the hostname in the
front of each chassis.

<sect id=bootptab>Configuration of BOOTP daemon
<p>

An example configuration for the BOOTP daemon is included in FAI. If
you have no <file>/etc/bootptab</file> file you can use
<file>/usr/share/doc/fai/examples/etc/bootptab</file> as template.

<example>
# /etc/bootptab example for FAI
# replace FAISERVER with the name of your install server

.faiglobal:\
	:ms=1024:\
	:hd=/boot/fai:\
	:hn:bs=auto:\
	:rp=/usr/lib/fai/nfsroot:

# rp: $NFSROOT
# your local values
#
# sa: your tftp server (install server)
# ts: your timeserver (time enabled in inetd.conf)
# T170 location of FAI configuration directory
# T171 FAI_ACTION
# T172 FAI_FLAGS, e.g. verbose, debug, reboot, sshd
# T173 reserved for future use
# T174 reserved for backup devices and backup options; NOT YET USED
# sm: subnet mask
# gw: router/gateway address
# dn: domainname
# ds: list of nameservers

# these are optional
# ys: NIS server
# yd: NIS domainname
# nt: list of NTP servers

.failocal:\
	:tc=.faiglobal:\
	:sa=FAISERVER:\
	:ts=FAISERVER:\
        :T170="FAISERVER:/usr/local/share/fai":\
	:T171="sysinfo":\
	:sm=255.255.255.0:\
	:gw=134.95.9.254:\
	:dn=informatik.uni-koeln.de:\
	:ds=134.95.9.136,134.95.100.209,134.95.100.208,134.95.140.208:\
	:ys=rubens:yd=informatik4711.YP:\
	:nt=time.rrz.uni-koeln.de,time2.rrz.uni-koeln.de:

# now one entry for each install client
faiserver:ha=0x00105A240012:bf=faiserver:tc=.failocal:T171="sysinfo":T172="sshd verbose debug ":
faiclient01:ha=0x00105A000000:bf=faiclient01:tc=.failocal:T172="sshd":
</example>

Insert one line for each install client at the end of this file as
done for <em>faiserver</em> and <em>faiclient01</em>. Replace the
string <tt>FAISERVER</tt> with the name of your server (where you
installed the package FAI). Then adjust the other network tags (sm,
gw, dn, ds) to your local needs. The tags for NIS and time servers
(yp, yd, nt) are optional. Tags with prefix <tt>T</tt> (starting from
T170) are generic tags which are used to transfer some FAI specific
data to the clients. <strong> It is important, that T171 is set to
sysinfo !</strong> Later you can set it to <em>install</em>, in order
to start the automatic installation. For more information see <manref
name="bootptab" section="5"> and section (TODO: explain all tags).
<p>

When you have created your <file>/etc/bootptab</file> you have to
enable the BOOTP daemon once. It's installed but Debian does not enable it
by default. Edit <file>/etc/inetd.conf</file> and remove the comment
(the hash) in the line containing <tt>#bootps</tt>. Then tell
<prgn>inetd</prgn> to reload its configuration.

<example># /etc/init.d/inetd reload</example>


I recommend to use the BOOTP daemon because it automatically reloads
the configuration file if any changes are made to it. The daemon for
DHCP must always be manually restarted after changes to the
configuration file are made <footnote> <p>If you can't use one of
these, there's also the possibility to supply all information via a file
or compile them into the kernel, but it's easier to use a daemon. See XXXX
</p>
</footnote>. Now it's time to boot all install clients again!

<sect id="boot">Boot messages <p>

These are messages, when booting from floppy.
<example>
LILO Loading FAI-BOOTP.

The rest of the boot message will be equal to those of booting from network card.


When booting from network card you will see:

Fully Automatic Installation for Debian GNU/Linux
------------------------------------------------------------
.
.
.
Press &lt;RETURN&gt; to reboot or ctrl-c to execute a shell
</example>

There will be some error message from modprobe and insmod, but that
doesn't matter.  If you get the following error message, the kernel has
no driver compiled in for your network card. Compile a new kernel
which supports your network card.
<example>
IP-Config: No network devices available
Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 < hda5 hda6 hda7 hda8 >
Root-NFS: No NFS server available, giving up.
VFS: Unable to mount root fs via NFS, trying floppy.
VFS: Insert root floppy and press ENTER
</example>


<sect1 id="sysinfo">Collecting other system information<p>

Now the clients have booted using the action <em>sysinfo</em>. Type
<tt>ctrl-c</tt> to get a shell, or log from your server into the client (for
eg. named faiclient01) using the secure shell:
<example>> ssh -l root faiclient01
Warning: Permanently added 'faiclient01,134.95.9.200' to the list of known hosts.
root@faiclient01's password: 
</example>

You have now a shell and can execute various commands (dmesg, lsmod,
df,...). Look at the log file in <file>/tmp</file>. There you can find
much information about the boot process.

All log files from <file>/tmp </file> are also written to the server in the directory <tt>~fai/faiclient01/sysinfo/</tt>.

<p>
A very nice feature is, that FAI mounts all filesystems
it finds on the local disks read only. It also tells you on
which partition a file <file>/etc/fstab</file> exists. When only one
fstab is found, the partitions are mounted according to this
information. Here's an example:
<example>
faiclient01:~# df
Filesystem   1k-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/root      1249132  855648    330032  72% /
/dev/ram0         3963      36      3927   1% /tmp
kueppers:/usr/local/share/fai
               1249132  855648    330032  72% /fai
/dev/hda1        54447    9859     41777  19% /tmp/target
/dev/hda10     1153576      20   1141992   0% /tmp/target/files/install
/dev/hda9       711540      20    711520   0% /tmp/target/home
/dev/hda8       303336      13    300191   0% /tmp/target/tmp
/dev/hda7      1517948   98252   1342588   7% /tmp/target/usr
/dev/hda6       202225    8834    182949   5% /tmp/target/var
</example>

<strong>This method can be used as an rescue environment !</strong> In
future it will be possible to make backups or restore data to existing
filesystems. If you need a filesystem with read-write access try:

<example>faiclient01:~# mount -o remount,rw /tmp/target/home</example> 

Reboot the computer using the command <prgn>faireboot</prgn>.

<chapt id=instprocess>The installation process<p>

FAI can perform several action when the client is booting. This action
is defined in the variable <var>FAI_ACTION</var><footnote>
	  <p>Theses names are used in the main installation
script <file>rcS_fai</file>. The configuration files for DHCP and BOOTP daemons use other
names. Example: <var>FAI_ACTION</var> is equal to <tt>T171</tt> in
bootptab or <tt>option-171</tt> in dhcp.conf. </p>
	</footnote>.

Be very carefully if you set <var>FAI_ACTION </var> to
<em>install</em>. This can destroy all your data on the install
client, indeed most time it should do this ;-). It's recommended to change this only
on a per client base in the BOOTP configuration. Do not change it in
the section <tt>.failocal</tt> in <file>/etc/bootptab</file> which
is a definition for all clients.

<chapt id=config>The configuration<p>
The configuration is the collection information how to partition local
hard disks, where to mount the filesystems, which software packages to
install, and how to make local customization to the installation. The
configuration space is located on the server in
<file>/usr/local/share/fai</file> and is mounted by the install
clients to <file>/fai</file>. Following subdirectories are available:

<taglist>
	  <tag><tt>fai_config/</tt></tag> <item> <p>global parameters</p> </item>
	  <tag><tt>class/</tt></tag> <item> <p>scripts and files to
	  load kernel modules and define classes</p> </item>
	  <tag><tt>disk_config/</tt></tag> <item> <p>configuration
	  files for disk partitioning and file system creation</p> </item>
	  <tag><tt>package_config/</tt></tag> <item> <p>software
	  packages to be installed or removed</p> </item>
	  <tag><tt>scripts/</tt></tag> <item> <p>script for customization</p> </item>
	  <tag><tt>files/</tt></tag> <item> <p>files used by
	  customization scripts</p> </item>
</taglist>

The main installation script <prgn>rcS_fai</prgn> uses these
subdirectories in the listed order.




<sect id=classes>Defining classes<p>
All defined classes are listed in <file>FAI_CLASSES</file>. You can
also set <var>FAI_ACTION</var> to <em>showclasses</em>.

<sect id=diskconfig>Hard disk configuration<p>
Please read <file>/usr/share/doc/fai/README.disk_config.gz</file>.

<sect id=packageconfig>Software package configuration<p>
Please read <file>/usr/share/doc/fai/README.package_config.gz</file>.


<sect id=errors>Looking for errors<p>
If the installation process stops or even it finishes, parse all log files for errors using:
<example>
> egrep "no such variable|bad variable|E:|ERROR" *.log
</example>

A CVS repository for the development version of FAI is available (the password is: fai):

<example>
> CVSROOT=":pserver:anonymous@poolserver.informatik.uni-koeln.de:/home/fai/cvs"
> cvs login
> cvs co -P fai

	    <tag>Hint for developers
	    <item>If you do not want to use BOOTP and DHCP, you can
	    define all variables in
	    <file>/usr/lib/fai/nfsroot/fai/fai_config/hostname.conf AND global.conf XXX</file> because it's read before the real
	    fai configuration directory is mounted.

ERROR HINTS

!-->
<!-- 

create boot floppy (dhcp, bootp), boot from network card, get MAC address
set up bootp/dhcp action=sysinfo

The only task, which has to be done manually for new hardware, is to
assign the MAC address to a hostname and to an IP-address and to
define classes for this host, or all host which match a certain name
(look at <file>class/S01alias.sh</file>).

Before installing the FAI package on your server, you should plan your
installation. 

general hints:

all in one config file, or multiple small config files. Ypou can
choose !

470 MB Software in 10 minutes (10 or 100Mbit is equal when only one
client is installing)
