<chapt id="motivation">Motivation<p>
There was lot of motivation for creating FAI ! TODO ...

<chapt id="overview">Overview and concepts of FAI<p>
<p>
FAI is a non interactive system to install a &dgl operating system on
a single computer or a whole cluster. You can take one or more virgin
PC's, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed,
configured and running on the whole cluster, without any interaction
necessary. Thus, it's a scalable method for installing and updating a
cluster unattended with little effort involved. FAI uses the &dgl;
distribution and a collection of shell and perl scripts for the
installation process. Changes to the configuration files of the
operating system can be made by cfengine, shell, perl and expect scripts.

<p>
FAI's target group are system administrators how have to install
Debian onto one or even hundreds of computers. Because it's a general
purpose installation tool, it can be used for installing a beowulf
cluster, a rendering farm or a linux laboratory or a classroom. Also
large-scale linux networks with different hardware or different installation
requirements are easy to establish using FAI.

First, some terms used in this manual, are described.

<taglist>
	  <tag> install server : <item> <p>The host, where the package FAI
	  is installed. It provides several services for all install clients.

	  <tag>install client : <item> A host, which will be installed using
	  FAI and a configuration from the install server. Also called
	  client for short.</p> </item>
	  <tag> configuration : <item> The details, how the installation
	  of the clients should be performed. This includes information about:
<list>
		<item> <p>Hard disk layout</p> </item>
		<item> <p>Local filesystems</p> </item>
		<item> <p>Software packages</p>	</item>
		<item> <p>Keyboard layout, time zone, NIS,
		X11 configuration, remote filesystems, user accounts,
		printers ...</p>	</item>
</list>
	  <tag> nfsroot : <item> A filesystem located on the install
	  server. It's the complete filesystem for the install
	  client, which is mounted by the client during installation process.</item>
</taglist>

<sect id="work">How does FAI work ?<p> 

The computer, which will be installed using FAI (called client), is
booted from floppy disk or via network card. It gets an IP-address and
boots a linux kernel which mounts all filesystems via NFS from the isntall
server. After the operating system is running, the FAI startup script
performs the automatic installation which doesn't need any
interaction. First, the hard disks will be partitioned, filesystems are
created and then software packages are installed. After that, the new
installed operating system is configured to your local needs using
some scripts. Finally the new oprating system will be booted from the local
disk.
<p>
The details, of how to install the computer (the configuration), are stored in the
configuration space on the install server. Configuration files are shared
among multiple computers if the are similar. So you need not to create a
configuration for every new host. Hence, FAI is a scalable method to
install a big cluster with a great number of nodes.

<p>
FAI can also be used as an network rescue system. You can boot your
computer without performing an installation. Instead it will run a
fully functional &dgl without using the local hard disks. Then you can
do a remote login and backup or restore a disk partition, check a filesystem,
inspect the hardware or do any other task.

<chapt id="inst">Installing FAI
<sect id="requirements">Requirements<p> 

Following items are required for an installation via FAI.

<taglist>
	  <tag>BOOTP or DHCP server: </tag><item> <p> 
The clients need one of these daemons to obtain information.<footnote>
		  <p>It's also possible without a server, if all
information a included on the boot disk.</p>
		</footnote>
 </p> </item>

	  <tag>TFTP server:<item> The TFTP daemon is used for
	  transfering the kernel to the clients. Only needed when booting from network card.</item>
	  <tag>Debian mirror:<item> Access to a Debian
	  mirror is needed. A local mirror of all Debian
	  packages is recommended if you install multiple computers.</item>
	  <tag>Install kernel image: <item> A kernel image that supports the
	  network card and mounts its root filesystem via NFS. </item>
	  <tag>Configuration space:<item> A mountable directory which contains the configuration data. </item>
	</taglist>
<p>

The TFTP daemon and a NFS server will be enabled
automatically when installing the FAI package. Different install
kernel images for BOOTP and DHCP are available within the package. All
clients must have a network card, which is recognized by the install kernel.
<p>

The FAI package is available as a Debian package from &faidownload;
until it will be an official Debian package soon. 


<sect id="debian-mirror">How to create a local Debian mirror<p> 
TODO

<sect id=aptsetup> Setting up FAI
<p>

First, get the newest version of FAI and install it using the
<prgn>dpkg</prgn> command:

<example>
kueppers[~]# dpkg -i fai_1.4.1_i386.deb
Selecting previously deselected package fai.
(Reading database ... 39564 files and directories currently installed.)
Unpacking fai (from fai_1.4.1_i386.deb) ...
Setting up fai (1.4.1) ...
To set up FAI edit /etc/fai.conf and call fai-setup
</example>
<p>

All definitions for the FAI package are defined in
&fc;. Since FAI doesn't use <prgn>debconf</prgn>
yet, edit this file and call <prgn>fai-setup</prgn>.
These are important variables in &fc;:

<taglist>
	    <tag><var>FAI_BASETGZ</var></tag>
	    <item>
	      <p>The location, where the the base file is fetched
	      from. For building the nfsroot, the Debian base system
	      is needed. It's a big tar file (&basetgzsize for
	      &basetgz) , which is a minimal collection of all
	      required packages for Debian. It is not used, when a
	      file &basetgz is already available in
	      <file>/tmp</file>. Fetching via ftp or http could take
	      much time, if you do not have a fast connection to
	      your Debian mirror. You can find the current version in the directory
	      <tt>debian/dists/stable/main/disks-i386/current/</tt> of
	      your Debian mirror.</p>
	    </item>

	    <tag><var>FAI_SOURCES_LIST</var></tag>
	    <item>
	      <p>This multi line string is the definition for
<file>sources.list</file> (used by <manref name="apt-get"
section="8">), which defines the location and access method of the Debian
mirror. For more information on the file format see <manref
name="sources.list" section="5">.  </p> </item>

	    <tag><var>FAI_PACKAGE_DIR</var></tag>
	    <item>
	      <p> If you have NFS access to your local Debian mirror,
	      specify the remote filesystem. It will be mounted to
	      <var>$MNTPOINT</var>. It's not needed if you use FTP or
	      HTTP access.</p> </item>

	    <tag><var>KERNELPACKAGE</var></tag>
	    <item>
	  <p> You must specify the software package (build with <manref
	      name="make-kpkg" section="8">), which includes
	      the default kernel for booting the install clients. The
	      Debian package <package>fai-kernels</package> contains the
	      default install kernels with BOOTP and DHCP support.</p></item>
	<tag> <var>NFSROOT_PACKAGES</var></tag>
	    <item>
	  <p> Contains a list of additional software package, that
	  will be installed to nfsroot.</p></item>
	  </taglist>


<p>
FAI uses <manref name="apt-get" section="8"> to create the nfsroot
filesystem in <file>/usr/lib/fai/nfsroot</file>, which needs about &nfsrootsize of free disk
space. You should also install the package <package>fai-kernels</package>,
which will be automaticlly installed when you use <prgn>apt-get</prgn> for
installing FAI.
<example>
kueppers[~]# dpkg -i ~lange/fai-kernels_1.0_i386.deb 
Selecting previously deselected package fai-kernels.
(Reading database ... 40562 files and directories currently installed.)
Unpacking fai-kernels (from .../lange/fai-kernels_1.0_i386.deb) ...
Setting up fai-kernels (1.0) ...
</example>

Before setting up FAI, you should get the program <prgn>imggen</prgn>,
if you like to boot from a 3Com network card. This executable
converts netboot images, so they can be booted by 3Com cards. You can
get this compiled program from the download page &faidownload;. Put
that executable in your path (e.g. <file>/usr/local/bin</file>). After
editing &fc; call <prgn>fai-setup</prgn>.

<example>
kueppers[/home/lange]# fai-setup 
Adding system user fai...
Stopping Name Service Cache Daemon: nscd.
Adding new user fai (100) with group nogroup.

Adding MBA support...
MBA support has been succesfully added 
You have no FAI configuration. Copy FAI template files with:
cp -pR /usr/share/doc/fai/templates/* /usr/local/share/fai
Then change the configuration files to meet your local needs.
FAI setup finished.
</example>

<p>
The setup routine adds lines to <file>/etc/exports</file> to
export some directories to all hosts that belong to the netgroup
<em>faiclients</em>. Netgroups are defined in
<file>/etc/netgroup</file> or in the correspondening NIS map. An
example for the netgroup file can be found in
<file>/usr/share/doc/fai/examples/etc/netgroup</file>. For more
information, read the manual pages <manref name="netgroup" section="5">
and the NIS HOWTO. After changing the netgroups 
, the nfs server has to reload its configuration. 
Use one of the following commands, depending on which nfs server you are
using:

<example>
kueppers[~]# /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server reload
kueppers[~]# /etc/init.d/nfs-server reload
</example>

<p>
The set up also creates the account <tt>fai</tt>
($LOGUSER). If you will boot from network card, you should change the
primary group of this account, so this account has write permissions
to <file>/boot/fai</file> in order to change symbolic links to the
kernel image, that is bootet by a client. See also <file>/etc/fai.conf</file>.


<p>
After that, FAI is installed successfully on your server, but has no
configuration for the install clients. Start with the templates from
<tt> /usr/share/doc/fai/templates</tt> using the copy command above
and read <ref id="config">. Before you can set up a DHCP or BOOTP
daemon, you should collect some network information of all your
install clients. This is described in section <ref id="bootfloppy">.

<p>
When you make changes to &fc or want to install a new kernel to
nfsroot, the nfsroot has to be rebuild by calling <prgn>fai-setup</prgn>.

<chapt id="booting">Booting hosts <p>

Now it's time to boot your install clients for the first time. You can
use the boot floppy or configure them to boot via network card, which
is much smarter. They will fail to boot, because no BOOTP or DHCP
daemon is running yet or recognizes the hosts. But you can use this
first boot attempt to easily collect all Ethernet addresses of the
network cards.

<sect id="nicboot">Configuring a 3Com network card
<p>
If you have a 3Com network card that is equipped with a boot ROM by
Lanworks Technologie or already includes the DynamicAccess Managed PC Boot Agent (MBA)
<footnote>   <p>see <httppath>http://www.3com.com/products/software/dynamicaccess/</httppath>)</p></footnote>
 
 software, you can enter the MBA setup by typing
<tt>Ctrl+Alt+B</tt> during boot. The setup will look like this:

===============================================================================
                            Configuration

Boot Method:                TCP/IP
Protocol:                   BOOTP
Default Boot:               Network
Local Boot:                 Enabled
Config Message:             Enabled
Message Timeout:            3 Seconds
Boot Failure Prompt:        Wait for key
===============================================================================
  Use cursor keys to edit: Up/Down change field, Left/Right change value
  ESC to quit, F9 restore previous settings, F10 to save
</example>

Set the boot method to <tt>TCP/IP</tt> and the protocol to either
<tt>BOOTP</tt> or <tt>DHCP</tt>. I prefer the BOOTP protocol.

<sect id="pxeboot">Booting a PXE conforming boot ROM
<p>
My notebook has an builtin Intel EtherExpress PRO 100 network card,
with a fixed configuration for booting using the PXE method. This
requires a PXE Linux XXXxx. See MAILLINGLIST XXXXXXXX for more information, how to
boot in such an environment.

See also <file>/usr/share/doc/syslinux/pxelinux.doc.gz</file>.

<sect id="bootnetwork">Set up booting via network card
<p>
You will find two install kernels in <file>/boot/fai</file>. Make a
symbolic link from the hostname of your client to the appropriate
kernel image. The file <file>installimage_3com</file> is created by
<prgn>imggen</prgn> and suitable for booting 3Com network cards.

<example> 
kueppers[~]# cd /boot/fai
kueppers[~]# ln -s installimage_3com faiserver
</example>


<sect id="bootfloppy">Creating the boot floppy
<p>
If your network card can't boot itself, you have to boot via
floppy. Use the command <prgn>make-fai-bootfloppy</prgn> to create the
boot floppy. Since there's no client specific information on this
floppy, it's suitable for all your install clients.

<sect id="mac">Collecting Ethernet addresses
<p>
You have to collect all Ethernet (MAC) addresses of the install clients
and assign a hostname and IP address to each client. To collect 
 all MAC addresses, now boot all your install clients. While the
install clients are booting, they send broadcast packets to the LAN. You
can log the MAC addresses of these hosts, if following
command is running simultaneously on the server:

<example># tcpdump -qte broadcast and port bootpc >/tmp/mac.lis</example>

<p>
XXXXXXXXXX Was ist bei DHCP ?
<p>
After the hosts has been sent some broadcast packets (they will fail
to boot because <prgn>bootpd</prgn> isn't running or does not recognise the MAC
address yet) abort <prgn>tcpdump</prgn> by typing <tt>ctrl-c</tt>. You get a list
of all unique MAC addresses with these commands:

<example># perl -ane 'print "\U$F[0]\n"' /tmp/mac.lis|sort|uniq</example>

After that, you only have to assign these MAC addresses to hostnames
and IP addresses (<file>/etc/ethers</file> and <file>/etc/hosts</file>
or corresponding NIS maps). With these information you can configure
your <prgn>BOOTP</prgn> or <prgn>DHCP</prgn> daemon (see the section
<ref id="bootptab">).  I recommend to write the MAC addresses (last
three bytes will suffice if you have network card from the same
vendor) and the hostname in the front of each chassis.

<sect id=bootptab>Configuration of BOOTP daemon
<p>

An example configuration for the BOOTP daemon is included in FAI. If
you have no <file>/etc/bootptab</file> file you can use
<file>/usr/share/doc/fai/examples/etc/bootptab</file> as template.

<example>
# /etc/bootptab example for FAI
# replace FAISERVER with the name of your install server

.faiglobal:\
 :ms=1024:\
 :hd=/boot/fai:\
 :hn:bs=auto:\
 :rp=/usr/lib/fai/nfsroot:

# rp: $NFSROOT

# T172 FAI_FLAGS, e.g. verbose, debug, reboot, sshd
# T173 reserved for future use
# T174 reserved for backup devices and backup options; NOT YET USED
# sm: subnet mask
# gw: router/gateway address

 :ds=134.95.9.136,134.95.100.209,134.95.100.208,134.95.140.208:\
 :ys=rubens:yd=informatik4711.YP:\
 :nt=time.rrz.uni-koeln.de,time2.rrz.uni-koeln.de:

# now one entry for each install client
faiserver:ha=0x00105A240012:bf=faiserver:tc=.failocal:T171="sysinfo":T172="sshd verbose debug ":
faiclient01:ha=0x00105A000000:bf=faiclient01:tc=.failocal:T172="sshd":
</example>

Insert one line for each install client at the end of this file as
done for <em>faiserver</em> and <em>faiclient01</em>. Replace the
string <tt>FAISERVER</tt> with the name of your install server. Then
adjust the other network tags (<tt>sm, gw, dn, ds</tt>) to your local
needs. The tags for NIS and time servers (<tt>yp, yd, nt</tt>) are
optional. Tags with prefix <tt>T</tt> (starting from T170) are generic
tags which are used to transfer some FAI specific data to the
clients. <strong> It is important, that T171 is set to sysinfo
!</strong> Later you can set it to <em>install</em>, in order to start
the automatic installation. For more information see <manref
name="bootptab" section="5"> and section (TODO: explain all tags).
<p>

When you have created your <file>bootptab</file> file, you have to
enable the BOOTP daemon once. It's installed but Debian does not enable it
by default. Edit <file>/etc/inetd.conf</file> and remove the comment
(the hash) in the line containing <tt>#bootps</tt>. Then tell
<prgn>inetd</prgn> to reload its configuration.

<example># /etc/init.d/inetd reload</example>

I recommend to use the BOOTP daemon and protocol for booting because
it automatically reloads the configuration file if any changes are
made to it. The daemon for DHCP must always be manually restarted
after changes to the configuration file are made <footnote> <p>If you
can't use one of these, there's also the possibility to supply all
information via a file or compile them into the kernel, but it's
easier to use a daemon.
</p>
</footnote>. Now it's time to boot all install clients again!

<sect id="boot">Boot messages <p>

These are the messages, when booting from floppy.
<example>
LILO Loading FAI-BOOTP.

Fully Automatic Installation for Debian GNU/Linux
------------------------------------------------------------
.
.
.
Press &lt;RETURN&gt; to reboot or ctrl-c to execute a shell
</example>

There will be some error message from modprobe and insmod, but that
doesn't matter. If you get the following error message, the kernel has
no driver compiled in for your network card. Compile a new kernel
which supports your network card.
<example>
IP-Config: No network devices available
Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 < hda5 hda6 hda7 hda8 >
Root-NFS: No NFS server available, giving up.
VFS: Unable to mount root fs via NFS, trying floppy.
VFS: Insert root floppy and press ENTER
</example>

To compile a new kernel, start using the default kernel configuration
of FAI. Call <prgn>make
menuconfig</prgn> and add a driver in menu <tt>Network device
support / Ethernet</tt>
which supports your network card. Then create a Debian package using:

<example>
kueppers# cd /usr/src/linux
kueppers# cp /usr/lib/fai/nfsroot/boot/config-2.2.17 .config
kueppers# make menuconfig
kueppers# make-kpkg clean
kueppers# make-kpkg --revision kueppers1 kernel-image
</example>

The created file is
<file>/usr/src/kernel-image-2.2.17_kueppers1_i386.deb</file>. Adjust 
the variable <var>KERNELPACKAGE</var> in  &fc; and rebuild the nfsroot
by calling.

<example>
kueppers# fai-setup
</example> 

After that, you have to create a new boot floppy. Now your network
card should be recognized and your host should boot correctly.

<sect1 id="sysinfo">Collecting other system information

<p>

Now the clients have booted using the action <em>sysinfo</em>. Type
<tt>ctrl-c</tt> to get a shell or use <tt>Alt-F2</tt> or
<tt>Alt-F3</tt> to open a virtual terminal, where you can log in as
<tt>root</tt> with the password defined by <var>FAI_ROOTPW</var> in
&fc;.  Remote login is available via the secure shell. To log in from
your server to the client (for eg. named faiclient01) use:

<example>> ssh -l root faiclient01
Warning: Permanently added 'faiclient01,134.95.9.200' to the list of known hosts.
root@faiclient01's password: 
</example>

You have now a shell and can execute various commands (dmesg, lsmod,
df,...). Look at the log file in <file>/tmp</file>. There you can find
much information about the boot process.

All log files from <file>/tmp </file> are also written to the server
in the directory <tt>~fai/faiclient01/sysinfo/</tt><footnote>More
general: <tt>~$LOGUSER/$HOSTNAME/FAI_ACTION/</tt>.
</footnote>

<p>
A very nice feature is, that FAI mounts all filesystems (all fs types
linux supports) it finds on the local disks read only. It also tells
you on which partition a file <file>/etc/fstab</file> exists. When
only one fstab is found, the partitions are mounted according to this
information. Here's an example:
<example>
faiclient01:~# df
Filesystem   1k-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/root      1249132  855648    330032  72% /
/dev/ram0         3963      36      3927   1% /tmp
kueppers:/usr/local/share/fai
               1249132  855648    330032  72% /fai
/dev/hda1        54447    9859     41777  19% /tmp/target
/dev/hda10     1153576      20   1141992   0% /tmp/target/files/install
/dev/hda9       711540      20    711520   0% /tmp/target/home
/dev/hda8       303336      13    300191   0% /tmp/target/tmp
/dev/hda7      1517948   98252   1342588   7% /tmp/target/usr
/dev/hda6       202225    8834    182949   5% /tmp/target/var
</example>

<strong>This method can be used as an rescue environment !</strong> In
future it will be possible to make backups or restore data to existing
filesystems. If you need a filesystem with read-write access try:

<example>faiclient01:~# mount -o remount,rw /tmp/target/home</example> 

Reboot the computer using the command <prgn>faireboot</prgn>.

<chapt id=instprocess>The installation process<p>

FAI can perform several actions when the client is booting. This action
is defined in the variable <var>FAI_ACTION</var><footnote>
	  <p>Theses names are used in the main installation
script <file>rcS_fai</file>. The configuration files for DHCP and BOOTP daemons use other
names. Example: <var>FAI_ACTION</var> is equal to <tt>T171</tt> in
bootptab or <tt>option-171</tt> in dhcp.conf. </p>
	</footnote>.

Be very carefully if you set <var>FAI_ACTION </var> to
<em>install</em>. This can destroy all your data on the install
client, indeed most time it should do this ;-). It's recommended to change this only
on a per client base in the BOOTP configuration. Do not change it in
the section <tt>.failocal</tt> in <file>/etc/bootptab</file>, which
is a definition for all clients.
<p>

<sect id=isequence>The installation sequence<p>
Following steps are performed during an installation after the linux kernel
has booted on the install clients.

<enumlist>
	    <item> <p>Set up FAI </p> </item>
	    <item> <p>Define classes</p> </item>
	    <item> <p>Partitioning local disks</p> </item>
	    <item> <p>Create and mount local filesystems</p> </item>
	    <item> <p>Install software packages</p> </item>
	    <item> <p>Call site specific configuration scripts</p> </item>
	    <item> <p>Save log files</p> </item>
	    <item> <p>Reboot the new installed system</p> </item>
	  </enumlist>

<sect1 id=isetup>Set up FAI<p>

After the install client has booted the program
<file>/sbin/rcS_fai</file><footnote><p>Since the root filesystem on
the clients is mounted via NFS, <prgn>rcS_fai</prgn> is located in
<file>/usr/lib/fai/nfsroot/sbin</file> on the install server.</p>
</footnote> is executed. This is the main script, that controls the
sequence of tasks for FAI.
<p>
A ramdisk is created and mounted to <file>/tmp</file>, which is the
only writeable directory, until local filesystems are
mounted. Additional parameters are received from the BOOTP or DHCP
daemon <footnote><p>If these information daemons can't be used, FAI
also reads definitions from <file>/fai/fai_config/global.conf</file>
and <tt>/fai/fai_config/$HOSTNAME</tt>. This is done before and after
<file>/fai</file> is mounted from the install server. So the first
time the data will be read from
<file>/usr/lib/fai/nfsroot/fai/fai_config</file> and after mounting
<file>/fai</file> they are read from
<file>/usr/local/share/fai/fai_config</file>.
This is not the recommended way to specify the information. Use one
the daemons instead if possible!
</p></footnote>
and all needed remote filesystems are mounted. The set up is
finished after additional virtual terminals are created and the secure
shell daemon is started on demand.

<sect1 id=iclass>Define classes<p>

One of the most important feature of FAI are the classes. Using
classes you can share configuration data among multiple
clients. Details are described in <ref id="classes">.XXXX
All define classes are listed in <file>FAI_CLASSES</file>.

The main scripts executes all scripts in <file>/fai/class</file>,
which name conforms matches <tt>S[0-9]*.sh,pl}</tt>. Every word that these scripts
print to the standard ouput are interpreted as class names. A complete
description of all these scripts can be found in <ref id="cscripts">.

<p>
The script <file>S05modules.sh</file> and all file with suffix
<tt>.mod</tt> will load kernel modules but not define any class.
<p>
Script ending in <tt>.source</tt> are used for defining variables,
that are later used in the site specific configuration scripts.

<sect1 id=ipartition>Partitioning local disks<p>
After all classes and variables are defined, one disk configuration file
from <file>/fai/disk_config</file> is selected. It's a description
how the local disks will be partitioned, which filesystems should be
created or preserved and how they are mounted. Refer to XXXX for more information.
This is done by the command <prgn>setup_harddisks</prgn>, which uses
<prgn>sfdisk</prgn> for obtaining disk information and for partitioning.

<sect1 id=imount>Create and mount local filesystems<p>

Creation and mounting of filesystems are also done by
<prgn>setup_harddisks</prgn>. It's possible to specify parameters for
filesystems creation and also to give mount options.  All local
filesystems are mounted relativ to <file>/tmp/target</file> during the
installation process. So, for eg. <file>/tmp/target/home</file> will
become <file>/home</file> in the new installed system.  A more
detailed description is in XXXXX.  In future, this command will be
completely rewritten. Plans are to use <prgn>parted</prgn> and the
device filesystems <tt>devfs</tt>. Then things are becoming much easier.

<sect1 id=ipackages>Install software packages<p>
When local filesystems are created, they are all empty (except for
preserved partitions). Now the Debian base system and all requested
software packages must be installed on the new filesystems. First the
base tar file is unpacked, then the command
<prgn>install_packages</prgn> installes all packages witout any
manually interaction needed. If a packages requires an other packages,
<prgn>apt-get</prgn> resolves this dependency by installing the
required package.

<sect1 id=icscripts>Call site specific configuration scripts<p>

After all demanded software packages are installed, the system is
nearly ready to go. But not all default configurations of the software
packages will meet your site specific needs. So you can call arbitrary
scripts, which adjust the configuration. Therefore scripts, that match
a class name in <file>/fai/scripts</file><footnote>
<p><file>/usr/local/share/fai/scripts</file> on the install
server.</p> </footnote> will be executed. FAI comes with some
templates for these scripts, but you can write your own bourne/bash,
perl, cfengine or expect scripts.

<p>
Using cfengine, you can easily edit any existing text file or remove
files, create links or directories.  It has a rich set of editing
commands (AppendIfNoSuchLine, ReplaceAll, LocateLineMatching,
InsertLine, HashCommentLinesContaining,...) and support the use of
classes.
 
<p>If you have to create a new file or append many line to an exiting
one, it's better to use perl or a shell script. Cfengine is also
sensitive to undefined variables. A cfengine script does not get
executed, if any of the used variables is undefinded. Hence, it's not
useful if you have a variable number of parameters in your
configuration (a famous example are the DNS server for
<file>/etc/resolv.conf</file>).

<p>
For copying files use <prgn>fcopy</prgn>. It's included in FAI and can
handle classes Shell scripts are useful if most functions can be done
by unix commands, or a single command (e.g. calling lilo) must be
executed.
<p>

There's a tradeoff between writing a few large script, which
use definitions by cases or to write a single script for each
class. It may also be useful to write two scripts, that together
perform one task. Try to find the right way, and let us participate in
your scripts.

<sect1 id=isavelog>Save log files<p>
When all installation tasks are finished, the log files are written to
<tt>/var/log/fai/$HOSTNAME/install/</tt> on the new system and to the
install server, if <var>LOGUSER</var> is defined.

<sect1 id=ireboot>Reboot new installed system<p>
At least the system is automatically reboot. Only usefull if booting
from network card. Else you have to remove the floppy disk and type
return or call <prgn>faireboot</prgn> from a remote login. Currently
it's not possible to edit the BIOS from Linux, to change the boot
device, so next time the host will boot from another device (local
disk).


<chapt id=config>The configuration<p>
The configuration is the collection information how to partition local
hard disks, where to mount the filesystems, which software packages to
install, and how to make local customization to the installation. The
configuration space is located on the server in
<file>/usr/local/share/fai</file> and is mounted by the install
clients to <file>/fai</file>. Following subdirectories are available:

<taglist>
	  <tag><tt>fai_config/</tt></tag> <item> <p>global parameters</p> </item>
	  <tag><tt>class/</tt></tag> <item> <p>scripts and files to
	  load kernel modules and define classes</p> </item>
	  <tag><tt>disk_config/</tt></tag> <item> <p>configuration
	  files for disk partitioning and file system creation</p> </item>
	  <tag><tt>package_config/</tt></tag> <item> <p>software
	  packages to be installed or removed</p> </item>
	  <tag><tt>scripts/</tt></tag> <item> <p>script for customization</p> </item>
	  <tag><tt>files/</tt></tag> <item> <p>files used by
	  customization scripts</p> </item>
</taglist>

The main installation script <prgn>rcS_fai</prgn> uses these
subdirectories in the listed order.




<sect id=classes>Defining classes<p>

The only task, which has to be done manually for new hardware, is to
assign the MAC address to a hostname and to an IP-address and to
define classes for this host, or all host which match a certain name
(look at <file>class/S01alias.sh</file>).

Before installing the FAI package on your server, you should plan your
installation. 

general hints:

all in one config file, or multiple small config files. Ypou can
choose !
