New in FAI 2.3

    - /etc/fai.conf moved to /etc/fai/fai.conf
    - moved some variables from fai.conf to class/*.var
    - add FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP_OPTS to fai.conf
    - temporary files are stored to $LOGDIR (default to /tmp/fai/),
    - can be set in fai.conf using mktemp if desired
    - if a task is skipped, also all its hooks are skipped
    - uname -s in uppercase is also a default class
    - all class/S[0-9]*.source scripts are sourced
    - hooks that end in .source are sourced (formerly .sh), so they
      can define variables
    - new adddivert routine; make a diversion for a file and add it to
      the list of all diversions; you need not care about removing the
      diversion; the finish task will do this for you
    - class/*.mod files can now define variables
    - new examples class/S30menu.source (was hook/install.MENU)
    - /fai can be a different location using $FAI in fai.conf
    - /fai can be retrieved from a CVS repository: (see variables
      FAI_LOCATION, FAI_CVSROOT, FAI_CVSMODULE) and create a
      /etc/fai/.cvspass
    - /etc/apt/preferences will be copied to nfsroot
    - additional manual pages for fai-setup, make-fai-nfsroot,
      make-fai-bootfloppy, install_packages
    - setup_harddisks: called with option -d (DOS alignment)
      support for ext3 and disk controllers using /dev/ida/, /dev/rd/
      and /dev/cciss (Compaq SMART2 raid array and Mylex DAC960 PCI
      RAID controller)
    - make-fai-bootfloppy can write to a file, creates environment for
      DHCP using pxelinux, does not copy System.map to floppy (now
      more space left for the kernel image), new option -s
    - bootpc and dhcp request will use only active network devices
      ($netdevices_up determined by netdevice_info()) by default,
      which can be overwritten with $netdevices 
    - add a hint how to set up the kernel automounter for scratch
      partitions
    - fcopy skips CVS directories, executes postinst script if file
      was copied, new options -L and -P
    - added prtnetgr script which prints a flat list of all hosts
      belonging to a netgroup
    - execute all /fai/scripts/$class/S[0-9]* scripts if this
      directory exists, so it's possible to execute multiple scripts
      for one class; see examples in scripts/NETWORK/ and scripts/DEFAULT/
    - use shm (was tmpfs) for ramdisk if available
    - mkdebmirror uses passive ftp mode
    - task sysinfo calls kudzu
    - added THANKS file

New in FAI 2.2.3

    - woody support improved, but the default configuration is still
      for potato
    - added disk configuration for Beowulf nodes
    - Wake on LAN section added to FAI guide
    - reiserfs support in setup_harddisks (thanks to Diane Trout)
    - make-fai-nfsroot -v output can be redirected to a file
    - sysinfo also uses detect and discover to probe for hardware
    - utilities moved to /usr/share/fai/utils
    - install_packages checks all package names, if a package name is
      misspelt, it will be removed from the installation list
    - added class NOGETTY
    - package_config: new action "hold", PRELOAD can use a file: url

New in FAI 2.2.2

    - bug fix: getting dhcp information
    - added jmon to BEOWULF

New in FAI 2.2.1

    - FAI_FLAGS can be space or comma separated. They must be space
      separated in bootptab. Use a comma to separate them as
      additional kernel parameters.
    - bootp requests on multiple ethernet devices show device name
      (Thanks to Geert Stappers)
    - script all_hosts doesn't use hardcoded list of hosts any more;
      now it uses the netgroup allhosts

New in FAI 2.2

    - the fai guide has a new chapter about building a Beowulf cluster
    - new utilities for Beowulf cluster: all_hosts and rshall
    - new utility softupdate for updating packages on a running system
    - improved example for diskless hook
    - major reorganization of the rcS_fai code; most parts are moved
      to the subroutines file
    - source /fai/hooks/subroutines if file exists; here you can define
      your own subroutines or redefine FAI's subroutines
    - most tasks are now executed via task() and the name of the task
      as option. This subroutine looks for a hook with the given name
      and executes it. Hooks can skip the default task of FAI (called
      task_<name>) by using skiptask(). So, hooks can replace the
      default behavior, and not only add functions to the
      installation process
    - hooks can define classes by writing class names to
      /tmp/additional-classes and variable by writing line to
      /tmp/additional.var 
    - new hooks/tasks added
    - classes and variables are now defined in the very beginning
      before task_action is called and $FAI_ACTION is evaluated
    - FAI_ACTION can be any user defined value. FAI is looking for a
      command in /fai/hooks/$FAI_ACTION and executes it.
    - log file prepare-apt.log renamed to updatebase.log
    - debian-non-US in local mirror script (mkdebmirror) has new location
    - new type "PACKAGE taskinst" in package_config can install new
      task packages (for Debian 3.0 and later releases)
    - get_bootp_inf() and get_dhcp_info() support multiple ethernet
      devices via $netdevices
    - $netdevices can be set or automaticly determined to the list of
      ethernet devices
    - make-fai-bootfloppy: handle symlinks of lilo 21.5 and newer
    - tlink can show symlink of a host or all file in /boot/fai
    - new classes NOSECURETTY, BEOWULF, NOTCPD

New in FAI 2.1
    - NEWS file added (you found it already ;-), which contains the
      user visible changes; changelog file is for developers
    - woody support
    - define $FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP for using debootstrap
    - you can add your own functions using hooks (read the manual)
    - /fai/fai_config not used anymore, replaced by a hook
    - setup_harddisk does not complain when root partition is not in
      the first 8GB, do not complain if not a primary partition
    - no more problems when using other locales
    - support for diskless clients
    - grub support, new class LILO and GRUB
    - new flag createvt; add this to FAI_FLAGS to get two additional
      terminals and ctrl-c will interrupt the installation
      process. Otherwise ctrl-c will reboot and no terminals are
      available. In the past, this function was enabled by default.
      Add createvt to FAI_FLAGS to get the old behavior.
    - before any classes are defined using the scripts in /fai/class,
      the classes DEFAULT, $HOSTNAME and LAST are defined
    - new utility chkdebnames can check package names for a certain
      distribution
