New in FAI 2.2

    - major reorganisation of the rcS_fai code; most parts are moved
      to the subroutines file
    - most tasks are now executed via task() and the name of the task
      as option. This subroutine looks for a hook with the given name
      and executes it. If this hook creates the file /tmp/skip.<name>,
      then the default task of FAI (called task_<name>) will not be
      executed. So, hooks can replace the default command, and no only
      add functions to the installation process
    - FAI_ACTION can be any user defined value. FAI is looking for a
      command in /fai/hooks/$FAI_ACTION and executes it.
    - log file prepare-apt.log renamed to updatebase.log
    - source /fai/hooks/subroutines if available; here you can define
      your own subroutines or redefine FAI's subroutines
    - debian-non-US in local mirror script (mkdebmirror) has new location
    - new type "PACKAGE taskinst" in package_config can install new
      task packages (for Debian 3.0 and later releases)

New in FAI 2.1
    - NEWS file added (you found it already ;-), which contains the
      user visible changes; changelog file is for developers
    - woody support
    - define $FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP for using debootstrap
    - you can add your own functions using hooks (read the manual)
    - /fai/fai_config not used anymore, replaced by a hook
    - setup_harddisk does not complain when root partition is not in
      the first 8GB, do not complain if not a primary partition
    - no more problems when using other locales
    - support for diskless clients
    - grub support, new class LILO and GRUB
    - new flag createvt; add this to FAI_FLAGS to get two additional
      terminals and ctrl-c will interrupt the installation
      process. Otherwise ctrl-c will reboot and no terminals are
      available. In the past, this function was enabled by default.
      Add createvt to FAI_FLAGS to get the old behavior.
    - before any classes are defined using the scripts in /fai/class,
      the classes DEFAULT, $HOSTNAME and LAST are defined
    - new utility chkdebnames can check package names for a certain
      distribution
