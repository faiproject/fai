.SH NAME
fai \- Fully Automatic Installation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fai
.RI [ options ] " ACTION"
.br
.B fai
.RI [ options ] " dirinstall DIRECTORY"
.br
.B fai
.RI [ options ] " install DIRECTORY"
.SH DESCRIPTION
FAI allows for non-interactive
initial installation and online maintenance ("softupdates") of operating systems
according to a user-defined configuration.
.LP
fai starts an fai-action, e.g. an installation or a softupdate.
If the variable FAI_ACTION is defined, this action will be
performed. The command line argument will override the value of
FAI_ACTION. You can also define your own actions which will be
executed when specified.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
ACTION is required.
.TP
.B \-C CFDIR
Use CFDIR as the configuration directory. Default is /etc/fai.
.TP
.BI "\-c|\-\-class " class[,class]
Define classes.  Multiple classes must be comma separated.  If not
specified, use the shell environment variable $classes (space
separated).  The first class has lowest priority.
.TP
.B \-h|\-\-help
Show help, version and summary of options.
.TP
.B \-N|\-\-new
Renew the list of defined classes. By default, FAI uses the list of
classes which was created during the first installation and skips
calling fai-class(1). You need this option for the first
softupdate if the system was not installed with FAI, you can also use
it in subsequent runs.
.TP
.B \-s|\--cspace <URL>
URL of the config space. See fai.conf for more information on the
format and which types of protocol are supported.
This overrides the setting of FAI_CONFIG_SRC in /etc/fai.
.TP
.B \-u|\--hostname <HOSTNAME>
Use this hostname instead the output of the hostname command. This is
useful in conjunction with the dirinstall action, where you
want to manually define a hostname that should be used for
defining classes and for the network setup and other stuff. There, you
don't want the name of the host where you run fai
dirinstall to be used - because programs in a chroot, or in a
virtualized OS instance should run with their own name, and install
their own set of classes.
.TP
.B \-v|\-\-verbose
Create verbose output.
.SH ACTIONS
.TP
.B install
starts a fully automatic installation:
.RS
.IP 1. 3
setup the fai environment (create ramdisk, get configuration data,...)
.IP 2. 3
define classes and variables
.IP 3. 3
partition the local hard disk and create file systems
.IP 4. 3
install new software packages
.IP 5. 3
call configuration scripts
.IP 6. 3
check and save the logfiles
.RE

.TP
.B sysinfo
starts a system rescue:
.RS
.IP 1. 3
setup the fai environment (create ramdisk, get configuration data,...)
.IP 2. 3
define classes and variables
.IP 3. 3
do different types of hardware detection and print hardware info
.IP 4. 3
save the logfiles
.RE

.TP
.B softupdate
starts a softupdate:
.RS
.IP 1. 3
fetch FAI configuration according to /etc/fai/fai.conf
.IP 2. 3
define classes and variables
.IP 3. 3
update the installed packages
.IP 4. 3
install new software
.IP 5. 3
call configuration scripts
.IP 6. 3
check and save the logfiles
.RE

.TP
.B inventory
print hardware inventory:
.RS
.IP 1. 3
setup the fai environment
.IP 2. 3
define classes and variables
.IP 3. 3
List information about CPU, RAM, network devices, hard disks
.IP 4. 3
save the logfiles
.RE

.TP
.B dirinstall [DIR]
Installation into a directory. This is nearly the same action as
install except for skipping the task that partitions the hard disks and
creates the file systems. Classes can be defined with option \-c, or by
giving the hostname with \-u or \-\-hostname and enabling automatic definition
by class scripts from hostname with \-N. (Without \-N class scripts aren't
executed)

.SH NOTES
Running with action "install" on a running system will almost
certainly destroy it.
.SH EXAMPLES

   fai \-v \-s file:///srv/fai/config \-cDEFAULT,FAIBASE dirinstall /srv/etchroot

This command will do an installation into the directory
/src/etchroot. For defining variables, selecting the software packages
and calling the customization script the classes DEFAULT, FAIBASE and
LAST are used.
