.SH NAME
fai-link \- create symlink idempotent
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fai-link
.RI "SOURCE TARGET"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Create or change a symlink from SOURCE to TARGET, check if this
symlink already exists and do a noop if it's already the same symlink.
If $target is defined, use it as prefix for SOURCE. If $verbose is
set, the command prints if no change has to be made.
The order of the arguments are different to the ln(1) command.
