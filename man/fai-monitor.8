.SH DESCRIPTION

.SH NOTES
Normally, the output will be piped to fai-monitor-gui, a GUI which displays
all information.

fai-monitor reads variables from /var/log/fai/variables (key=value pair
format) and replies to request from clients if they have the format:
VARIABLE <VARNAME>. For e.g. if the clients sends "VARIABLE FAI_VERSION",
fai-monitor will reply with OK and the value of this variable
(e.g. "OK 4.5.6") if this variable is defined, otherwise it will reply
with UNKNOWN and repeats the VARNAME (e.g. "UNKNOWN FAI_VERSION").
