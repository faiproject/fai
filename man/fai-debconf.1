.SH "NAME"
fai\-debconf \- set debconf values using classes
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B fai\-debconf
.RI [OPTION] " DIRECTORY"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command is only called internally by FAI and not directly by the user.

fai\-debconf reads files in DIRECTORY which are also a defined
class. If the name of the class is a directory, all files in this
directory are read. The files must have the format of debconf\-get\-selections(1).
All this input is used to call debconf\-set\-selections(1). This is done
in the chroot environment, if the variable $ROOTCMD is set. After
setting the debconf values, dpkg\-reconfigure(8) is called for every
package which is installed and for which some debconf data was set.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-h
Show help, version and summary of options.
