.SH NAME
make-fai-nfsroot \- create the FAI nfsroot directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B make-fai-nfsroot
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Create the FAI nfsroot directory as pointed by $NFSROOT in the
config_file.  This directory is necessary for the installation of
Debian on remote clients using the FAI package. The config_file
location is discussed in the OPTIONS below.

The exit code returned is 0 if all commands to build the root directory exited
successfully and >0 if an error occurs.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-B BASETGZ
Use specified BASETGZ file as base.tgz (or base.tar.xz or base.txz)
for the nfsroot. This avoids 
calling debootstrap and therefore reduces the buildtime for the nfsroot.
.TP
.B \-C CFDIR
Use CFDIR as configuration directory. Default is /etc/fai. You can
also set the environment variable FAI_ETC_DIR.
.TP
.B \-f
Force overwriting an existing nfsroot. By default make-fai-nfsroot aborts
if the configuration variable NFSROOT points to a directory which already
exists. To force overwriting (and therefore rebuilding) the existing nfsroot
use this option. This option is supported starting with FAI 4.0.
Note: To update and therefore preserve an existing nfsroot see option \-k.
.TP
.B \-K
Remove all kernels from NFSROOT. This is the same as calling aptitude
purge ~nlinux-image inside the nfsroot.
.TP
.B \-k
Install additional packages defined in /etc/fai/NFSROOT into the
nfsroot. Also copies all kernels from the nfsroot to the directory $TFTPROOT.
.TP
.B \-p
Preserve ssh keys. This will preserve the whole .ssh directory of the
root account inside the nfsroot.
.TP
.B \-U
Do not divert update-initramfs during build of the nfsroot. This
will slow down the creation process a bit. Use it in case of missing
initrd inside the nfsroot or when Ubuntu fails if the diversion exists.
.TP
.B \-v
Create verbose output on stdout.
.TP
.BI \-h
Show simple help.

.SH NOTES
.PD 0
If you do not use NFS, you may still use the NFSROOT
directory as a staging point for building the base installation tarball.
