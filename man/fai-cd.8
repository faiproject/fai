.SH DESCRIPTION
This command creates a bootable ISO CD-ROM image that performs the
fully automatic installation from CD-ROM without an install server. The
ISO image will be written to FILE. To create the image, the
command needs the NFSROOT, the configuration space and optionally a partial
mirror, which is created by fai-mirror. The ISO image will contain a compressed
squashfs filesystem. This hybrid CD image can also
be written to an USB stick using dd(1).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-A
Create a boot only CD image (also usable for an USB stick) with
autodiscover function. The CD will scan the subnet for a FAI
server. By default it shows a menu with all profiles available from
which you can select a type of installation. This image only needs 25MB.
You can add the -J option to make the image smaller.
.TP
.BI \-B
Create a boot only ISO image which does a network installation. It does not include the nfsroot, the
partitial mirror and the config space; however for it to automatically
initiate the installation -d has to be set. By default CONFIG_SRC will
be empty.
.TP
.BI \-b
After creating the ISO image burn it by calling wodim(1) (a version of
cdrecord).
.TP
.BI "\-C " CFDIR
Use CFDIR as the configuration directory. Default is /etc/fai. You can
also set the environment variable FAI_ETC_DIR.
.TP
.BI "\-d " URL
Do not include the config space in the image and set the location of the
config space to URL. This sets FAI_CONFIG_SRC in the grub config, which
is obtained from the FAI configuration dir (see -C). Set it to "" to not
set FAI_CONFIG_SRC. If not set, the config space is taken from
FAI_CONFIGDIR and copied to /var/lib/fai/config in the image. Currently
no file: is allowed here, instead set FAI_CONFIGDIR in fai.conf(5).
.TP
.BI \-e
Exclude the directory /var/tmp from the nfsroot. You may put the
file base.tar.xz in the configuration space into the subdirectory
basefiles. This option will save about 50MB of disk space. This option
will exclude the directory even when \-H is given.
.TP
.BI \-f
Force removal of an existing ISO image before creating a new one.
.TP
.BI "\-g " FILE
Use FILE as grub grub.cfg file. The script will look for FILE
in CFDIR. If FILE is located in another directory then a full path
must be specified. If not specified, use /etc/fai/grub.cfg.
.TP
.BI \-h
Show simple help and version.
.TP
.BI \-H
Do not hide directories. Using this option will consume about 45MB more
disk space on your media. By default, some directories like man pages
and locales are hidden and will not be put onto the CD or the USB stick.
.TP
.BI \-J
Use xz compression when calling mksquashfs. Default is gzip.
.TP
.BI "\-M "
Do not add the package mirror to the CD. Packages that would be fetched
from the mirror are obtained from the normal sources configured
elsewhere, usually remote repositories.
.TP
.BI "\-m " DIRECTORY
Use DIRECTORY as partial FAI mirror. This option is mandatory, unless
you use -M or -B.
.TP
.BI \-S
Create a squashfs image file instead of a complete iso. The image
contains the nfsroot and can be fetched through various ways over the
network. For an example, see the section "FAI without NFS" in the FAI
Guide.
.SH EXAMPLES
.br
After you've created a mirror with fai-mirror in /media/mirror, you
can create a CD using:

   # fai-cd \-m /media/mirror fai-cd.iso

If you want to create a bootable USB stick (here /dev/sdf) , write the
CD image to the stick via dd(1).

   # dd if=fai-cd.iso of=/dev/sdf bs=1M

It is possible to install over the network without using NFS, i.e. by
getting the nfsroot via an http request. To do so you have to create a
squashfs image using the following command:

   # fai-cd \-S squashfs.img

In addition to that you can create said image without a config space
and without a mirror. This is useful for when you want to avoid
creating a new image after modifying your config space or
updating your mirror:

   # fai-cd \-d "" \-SMeJ squashfs.img

To fetch the image via http, use the following kernel command line
option:

   root=live:http://your_server_or_IP/path/to/squashfs.img

Create the autodiscover boot image:

   # fai-cd \-JAg /etc/fai/grub.cfg.autodiscover fai-autod.iso

.SH NOTES
Additional kernel command line options can be found in the man page of
dracut.cmdline(7). fai-cd needs enough disk space in TMPDIR (/tmp by
default) for creating the compressed filesystem. You may want to set
it to another directories, before calling fai-cd.
