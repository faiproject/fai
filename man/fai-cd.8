.SH NAME
fai-cd \- make a bootable CD-ROM or USB stick that performs an FAI
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fai-cd
[\fIOPTION\fR] -m MIRROR \fIFILE\fR
.br
.B fai-cd
[\fIOPTION\fR] -m MIRROR \fI-u DIRECTORY\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command creates a bootable ISO CD-ROM image that performs the
fully automatic installation from CD-ROM without an install server. The
ISO image will be written to FILE. To create the image, the
command needs the NFSROOT, the configuration space and a partial
mirror, which is created by fai-mirror. The command can also copy all
needed data to DIRECTORY on a mounted USB stick.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-b
After creating the ISO image burn it by calling cdrecord(1).
.TP
.B \-C CFDIR
Use CFDIR as the configuration directory. Default is /etc/fai. You can
also set the environment variable FAI_ETC_DIR.
.TP
.BI \-f
Force removal of an existing ISO image before creating a new one.
.TP
.BI "\-g " FILE
Use FILE as grub menu.lst file. The script will looks for FILE in CFDIR.
If FILE is located in another directory then a full path
must be specified. If not specified, use /etc/fai/menu.lst.
.TP
.BI \-h
Show simple help and version.
.TP
.BI \-k
Keep the temporary filesystem for debugging. The script will sleep for
a long time, before continuing the cleanup of temp files and
mounts. Beware of killing or suspending the script itself, since a lot
of mounts will remain. This is for debugging only!
.TP
.BI "\-m " DIRECTORY
Use DIRECTORY as partial FAI mirror. This option is mandatory.
.TP
.BI \-n
No ISO image. Do not call mkisofs to create the ISO image. This is for
creating the filesystem only. Useful for writing it to a USB stick.
.TP
.BI "\-u " DIRECTORY
Create a bootable USB stick. The USB stick must be mounted on
DIRECTORY before you run fai-cd. Copies all FAI-CD data to DIRECTORY
and try to install grub onto its device. Currently the file system
on the USB stick must be ext2. USUALLY THIS WILL ERASE ALL DATA ON YOUR USB-STICK!

.SH EXAMPLES
.br
After you've created a mirror with fai-mirror in /media/mirror, you
can create a CD using:

   # fai-cd -m /media/mirror fai-cd.iso

If you want to create a bootable USB stick, create an ext2 file system
on your stick, mount it to /media/usbstick and call

   # fai-cd -m /media/mirror -u /media/usbstick
   # umount /media/usbstick
