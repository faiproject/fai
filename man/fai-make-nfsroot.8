.SH NAME
fai-make-nfsroot \- create the FAI nfsroot directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fai-make-nfsroot
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Create the FAI nfsroot directory as pointed by $NFSROOT in the
config_file.  This directory is necessary for the installation of
Debian on remote clients using the FAI package. The config_file
location is discussed in the OPTIONS below.

The exit code returned is 0 if all commands to build the root directory exited
successfully and >0 if an error occurs.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
Adjust a generic nfsroot. Add resolv.conf, add host entries, set the root password.
.TP
.B \-B BASETGZ
Use specified BASETGZ file as base.tgz (or base.tar.gz, base.tar.xz, base.txz)
for the nfsroot. This avoids
calling debootstrap and therefore reduces the buildtime for the nfsroot.
.TP
.B \-C CFDIR
Use CFDIR as configuration directory. Default is /etc/fai. You can
also set the environment variable FAI_ETC_DIR.
.TP
.B \-f
Force overwriting an existing nfsroot. By default fai-make-nfsroot aborts
if the configuration variable NFSROOT points to a directory which already
exists. To force overwriting (and therefore rebuilding) the existing nfsroot
use this option. This option is supported starting with FAI 4.0.
Note: To update and therefore preserve an existing nfsroot see option \-k.
.TP
.B \-g
Create a generic nfsroot. Remove most install server specific data from
nfsroot. See also -a.
.TP
.B \-K
Remove all kernels from NFSROOT.
.TP
.B \-k
Install additional packages defined in /etc/fai/NFSROOT into the
nfsroot. Also copies all kernels from the nfsroot to the directory $TFTPROOT.
You can use this option, to upgrade all packages inside the nfsroot.
Remember that the compressed base.tar archive is
.B *not*
rebuilt/compressed again.
Use -R for that in a second step.
.TP
.B \-N
Additionally install non-free packages defined in the NONFREE section of /etc/fai/NFSROOT.
.TP
.B \-P
Preserve ssh configs including the keys of the root account and also
the ssh host keys from inside the nfsroot.
.TP
.B \-p
Preserve ssh configs including the keys of the root account. This will
not preserve the ssh host keys inside the nfsroot.
.TP
.B \-R
Rebuild and compress base.tar archive after manual modification.
.TP
.B \-s
Create a smaller nfsroot. Do not install packages defined in /etc/fai/NFSROOT in the FULL section.
.TP
.B \-v
Create verbose output on stdout.
.TP
.BI \-h
Show simple help.
.TP
.B \-z
Use gzip for compressing the base.tar file. Default is to use xz.

.SH NOTES
.PD 0
If you do not use NFS, you may still use the NFSROOT
directory as a staging point for building the base installation tarball.
