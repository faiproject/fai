.SH NAME
install_packages \- install FAI configured packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B install_packages
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command is only called internally by FAI and not directly by the user.

install_packages is a Perl script written for FAI to selectively install, hold,
remove, or purge packages or tasks. Its function is to parse the package_config files based on
the class definitions of the client.  For example, if the client belonged to
the SMTPSERVER class, install_packages would parse ../package_config/SMTPSERVER
for instructions on what packages to install, hold, remove, or purge.

.SH NOTES
.PD 0
install_packages expects to find the FAI_ROOT directory, the location of class
definitions, package configurations, and custom install scripts, somewhere in
the filesystem.
