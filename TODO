TODO list for FAI, nov 8, 2001
--------------------------------
  
1. Support other Linux distributions (Red Hat, Suse,...). This should
   be the work for other people.
2. readable log files may contain encrypted passwords
3. redesign of setup_harddisk tool
   use mkfs instead of mke2fs
   support for other filesystem types and raid
   preserve partition layout, preserve data
   always clean /, /var and /usr
4. debconf support
5. translation of all messages and fai-guide

- apt-get remove should really purge
- T175 additional mount (e.g. for /usr/local)
- stop fai installation (killall -STOP ....) script
  faisstop (kill apt-get, yes, ...)
