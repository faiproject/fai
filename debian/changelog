    Tue Jan 29 20:19:27 CST 2002 -- Chad Walstrom <chad@debian.org>
    Added support to run script as a recovery operation.  This is a
    glue-script; we may as well provide the ability to fix problems and
    continue.  Changes include:
       - Adding a RUNDIR environment variable
       - A command line option "-r" for recover operations
       - logic tests and stampfiles to appropriate function calls
    Checked for existance of character file dev/boot255 before calling mknod.
    Checked for existance of $NFSROOT/proc/modules file before calling
    umount $NFSROOT/proc
    Recursively copies contents of /etc/fai/ directory (good if using CVS)
    Install $NFSROOT_PACKAGES in a second pass, to sidestep conflicts
    (e.g. so that ssh may replace rsh-client)
    Don't set up $LOGUSER's home directory if that variable is undefined
  * conf/fai_modules_off: more modules turned off
  * call openvt with full shell path (closes: #134641)

    subroutine:umount_local_disks, added $netdevices_up, use $tfsab
    instead of fstab (for solaris support), /fai is now $FAI, use shm
    instead of normal ramdisk when $USETMPFS is set, strip comment lines
    when defining classes via scripts, added subroutine do_script,
    do_scriptss calls every script class/<classname>/S[0-9]* when class is
    not a file, execute all S[0-9]* scripts in a directory
    /fai/scripts/$class/, skip all comment lines when definig classes
    task_partition() call setup_harddisk only if no disk_var.sh exists
    defclass also sources all scripts class/S*.source
    add subroutines adddivert(), rmalldivert(); task_finish calls
    rmalldivert
  * setup_harddisk: raid support for /devc/rd and /dev/ida, called with -d
  * doc/Makefile: detect if anything is really to do
  * use gzip -dc instead of zcat
  * make-fai-bootfloppy: do not copy /boot/System.map to floppy
  * added prtnetgr; change netgroup example and script all_hosts to use it
  * fcopy: added debug message if executing postinst, ignore CVS
    directories, use File::Find, now sets envionment variables $target and
    $FAI_ROOT, bug fix in -d option, new options -L and -P,
  * KERNELVERSION not needed in fai.conf, now automaticly determined in
    make-fai-* scripts
  * Files added: THANKS, preinst, prtnetgr, pxelinux.cfg
  * Manual pages added fai-setup, install_packages, make-fai-bootfloppy,
    make-fai-nfroot
