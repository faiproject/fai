  - some bug fixes

 -- Thomas Lange <lange@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Apr 2003 16:57:12 +0200

fai (2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  - Era Erikson did some great work on proofreading all manuals and
    script comments. Great work Era!
  - lots of updates in the fai guide
  - use the script fai-class for defining classes; scripts in class/
    must not have prefix S; the following command renames your
    existing scripts so they will work with the new command:
    rename 's/S(\d\d.+)(\.sh|\.pl)/$1/' S*
    the order of scripts executed has slightly changed; all classes
    from the file $HOSTNAME are defined after the scripts in class/
    are executed; the suffix .sh or .pl is not needed any more,
    fai-class has a manual page
  - kernel 2.4.20 is the default kernel during installation
  - USB keyboard support during installation
  - make-fai-bootfloppy creates a more generic boot floppy which
    uses grub or lilo as boot loader, it supports more than one boot
    protocol, more disk space is available on the floppy
  - the exit status of every hook and script is written to
    status.log
  - the hook faiend.LAST parses all log files for warnings and
    errors and writes them to error.log
  - variable.sh lists all variables defined after task defvar has finished
  - FAI_LOCATION is now defined in fai.conf, FAI_ACTION is defined
    in LAST.var, do not use T170 and T171 via a BOOTP or DHCP server
    (but it is still possible)
  - hooks can make their tasks to be skipped (as in fai 2.2)
  - templates scripts and config files has been rewritten and added
    (eg. WWWKIOSK, a notebook with Windows and Linux)
  - a new default location for the Debian mirror (in mkdebmirror and
    fai.conf)
  - much of reorganizing the code, but this does not change the user
    visible behavior
  - some functions that were defined as shell subroutines are now
    separate scripts in /usr/lib/fai (fai-class, create_ramdisk,
    prepare_apt, fai-divert, fai-savelog, task_sysinfo, ...), they
    are not standalone script, most of them only work in the fai
    environment, this should solve the problems with a too big
    environment (when using xargs)
  - PATH always starts with /usr/local/{sbin,bin}
  - new FAI_FLAG syslogd starts log daemons (syslogd and klogd) only
    on demand
  - save log files to host $LOGSERVER if defined, otherwise use
    $SERVER
  - make-fai-nfsroot always does setup for dhcp and bootp, and uses
    following sources to create the file sources.list for the
    nfsroot: the variable $FAI_SOURCES_LIST or the files
    /etc/fai/sources.list or /etc/apt/sources.list
  - you can add a list of classes after the PACKAGE command in files
    in package_config, so the following packages will only be
    installed for this class (Please only use this in the file
    package_config/DEFAULT)
  - fcopy has new option -i and -B
  - the variable addpackages can contain a list of packages without
    their version number, therefore /fai/files/packages should be a
    simple repository
  - a lot of bug fixes

 -- Thomas Lange <lange@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Feb 2003 11:45:29 +0100

fai (2.3.4) unstable; urgency=low

  - the default name for fai kernel-image package has changed to
    kernel-image-2.2.20_fai1_i386.deb, since the package fai-kernel
    >=1.4 contains install kernels which support both the BOOTP and
    DHCP protocol

  - /fai can be a different location using $FAI in fai.conf

    and /dev/cciss (Compaq SMART2 raid array and Mylex DAC960 PCI
    RAID controller)
  - make-fai-bootfloppy can write to a file, creates environment for
    DHCP using pxelinux, does not copy System.map to floppy (now
    more space left for the kernel image), new option -s
  - bootpc and dhcp request will use only active network devices
    ($netdevices_up determined by netdevice_info()) by default,
    which can be overwritten with $netdevices 
  - add a hint how to set up the kernel automounter for scratch
    partitions
  - fcopy skips CVS directories, executes postinst script if file
    was copied, new options -L and -P
  - added prtnetgr script which prints a flat list of all hosts
    belonging to a netgroup
  - execute all /fai/scripts/$class/S[0-9]* scripts if this
    directory exists, so it's possible to execute multiple scripts
    for one class; see examples in scripts/NETWORK/ and scripts/DEFAULT/
  - use shm (was tmpfs) for ramdisk if available
  - mkdebmirror uses passive ftp mode
  - task sysinfo calls kudzu

  - package_config: new action "hold", PRELOAD can use a file: url

 -- Thomas Lange <lange@debian.org>  Thu,  8 Nov 2001 17:01:02 +0100

fai (2.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  - bug fix: getting dhcp information
  - added jmon to BEOWULF

 -- Thomas Lange <lange@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Oct 2001 10:52:35 +0200

fai (2.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  - FAI_FLAGS can be space or comma separated. They must be space
    separated in bootptab. Use a comma to separate them as
    additional kernel parameters.
  - bootp requests on multiple ethernet devices show device name
    (Thanks to Geert Stappers)
  - script all_hosts doesn't use hardcoded list of hosts any more;
    now it uses the netgroup allhosts

 -- Thomas Lange <lange@debian.org>  Fri,  5 Oct 2001 17:19:14 +0200

fai (2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  - the fai guide has a new chapter about building a Beowulf cluster
  - new utilities for Beowulf cluster: all_hosts and rshall
  - new utility softupdate for updating packages on a running system
  - improved example for diskless hook
  - major reorganization of the rcS_fai code; most parts are moved
    to the subroutines file
  - source /fai/hooks/subroutines if file exists; here you can define
    your own subroutines or redefine FAIs subroutines
  - most tasks are now executed via task() and the name of the task
    as option. This subroutine looks for a hook with the given name
    and executes it. Hooks can skip the default task of FAI (called
    task_<name>) by using skiptask(). So, hooks can replace the
    default behavior, and not only add functions to the
    installation process
  - hooks can define classes by writing class names to
    /tmp/additional-classes and variable by writing line to
    /tmp/additional.var 
  - new hooks/tasks added
  - classes and variables are now defined in the very beginning
    before task_action is called and $FAI_ACTION is evaluated
  - FAI_ACTION can be any user defined value. FAI is looking for a
    command in /fai/hooks/$FAI_ACTION and executes it.
  - log file prepare-apt.log renamed to updatebase.log
  - debian-non-US in local mirror script (mkdebmirror) has new location
  - new type "PACKAGE taskinst" in package_config can install new
    task packages (for Debian 3.0 and later releases)
  - get_bootp_inf() and get_dhcp_info() support multiple ethernet
    devices via $netdevices
  - $netdevices can be set or automaticly determined to the list of
    ethernet devices
  - make-fai-bootfloppy: handle symlinks of lilo 21.5 and newer
  - tlink can show symlink of a host or all file in /boot/fai
  - new classes NOSECURETTY, BEOWULF, NOTCPD

fai (2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  - NEWS file added (you found it already ;-), which contains the
    user visible changes; changelog file is for developers
  - woody support
  - define $FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP for using debootstrap
  - you can add your own functions using hooks (read the manual)
  - /fai/fai_config not used anymore, replaced by a hook
  - setup_harddisk does not complain when root partition is not in
    the first 8GB, do not complain if not a primary partition
  - no more problems when using other locales
  - support for diskless clients
  - grub support, new class LILO and GRUB
  - new flag createvt; add this to FAI_FLAGS to get two additional
    terminals and ctrl-c will interrupt the installation
    process. Otherwise ctrl-c will reboot and no terminals are
    available. In the past, this function was enabled by default.
    Add createvt to FAI_FLAGS to get the old behavior.
  - before any classes are defined using the scripts in /fai/class,
    the classes DEFAULT, $HOSTNAME and LAST are defined
  - new utility chkdebnames can check package names for a certain
    distribution
