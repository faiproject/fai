Description:  Fully Automatic Installation
 FAI is a non-interactive system to install a Debian GNU/Linux operating
 system unattended on a PC cluster. You can take one or more virgin
 PCs, turn on the power, and after a few minutes, Linux is installed,
 configured, and running on the whole cluster, without any interaction
 necessary.  Homepage: http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai
