Description: Fully Automatic Installation client package
 FAI is a non-interactive system to install, customize and manage
 Linux systems and software configurations on computers as well as
 virtual machines and chroot environments, from small networks to
 large infrastructures and clusters.
 .
 This is the client package for FAI. It contains the parts necessary
 to run the softupdate functionality on already installed systems, and
 is needed for the dirinstall functionality and others on a FAI server.

Description: Documentation for FAI
 FAI is a non-interactive system to install, customize and manage
 Linux systems and software configurations on computers as well as
 virtual machines and chroot environments, from small networks to
 large infrastructures and clusters.
 .
 This is the documentation for FAI in various formats.

Description: Fully Automatic Installation server package
 FAI is a non-interactive system to install, customize and manage
 Linux systems and software configurations on computers as well as
 virtual machines and chroot environments, from small networks to
 large infrastructures and clusters.
 .
 It's a tool for mass unattended Linux installation. You can take one
 or more virgin systems, turn on the power, and after a few minutes,
 the systems are installed, and completely configured to your exact
 needs, without any interaction necessary.
 .
 This package is needed for setting up a FAI install server for network
 installations, for running the dirinstall in a chroot environment, and
 to build installation CD/DVD's and USB sticks.

Description: Fully Automatic Installation quickstart package
 FAI is a non-interactive system to install, customize and manage
 Linux systems and software configurations on computers as well as
 virtual machines and chroot environments, from small networks to
 large infrastructures and clusters.
 This package setups an install server with some basic
 examples. It should be removed when creating your own config space.

Package: fai-nfsroot

Description: Fully Automatic Installation nfsroot package
 FAI is a non-interactive system to install, customize and manage
 Linux systems and software configurations on computers as well as
 virtual machines and chroot environments, from small networks to
 large infrastructures and clusters.
 .
 This package contains the software that is only needed in
 the FAI nfsroot. Do not install this package on a normal machine.

Package: fai-setup-storage
Architecture: all
Depends: perl, libparse-recdescent-perl, liblinux-lvm-perl, parted, ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: lvm2, mdadm
Suggests: dmsetup, cryptsetup, dosfstools, jfsutils, ntfs-3g, reiserfsprogs, xfsprogs
Description: automatically prepare storage devices
 Using FAI disk_config files, setup-storage computes effective
 partition and volume sizes and executes the necessary commands
 to configure storage devices. It manages disk drives as well
 as RAID and LVM volumes. It handles all file systems supported
 by parted(8) as well as ntfs but is flexible enough to be
 extended to further types as well. Once the storage devices
 are prepared, an appropriate fstab(5) file is generated.
 .
 This package provides the setup-storage utility as separate
 package so it can be used independent from FAI as well.
